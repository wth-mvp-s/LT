Yes, you're correct. For photography that focuses on drawing and painting reproduction, both a full-frame sensor (often referred to as FX in Nikon's terminology) and a wider dynamic range can be beneficial:

Full-Frame Sensor (FX):

Detail and Clarity: FX sensors are larger and can capture more detail and clarity, which is crucial for accurately reproducing the fine details in drawings and paintings.
Better Color Reproduction: Full-frame cameras often have better color depth and tonal range, which helps in accurately capturing the colors in artwork.
Improved Low Light Performance: This can be particularly useful in controlled lighting environments, like studios, where you might be dealing with softer or more nuanced lighting setups.
Dynamic Range:

Detail in Highlights and Shadows: A wider dynamic range means the camera can capture a greater span of tones from the darkest to the brightest parts of an image. This is essential for artwork photography, where you need to capture all the nuances of the original piece, including subtle details in both shadows and highlights.
Post-Processing Flexibility: A higher dynamic range provides more flexibility in post-processing. You can adjust exposure, shadows, and highlights without losing details or introducing noise.
