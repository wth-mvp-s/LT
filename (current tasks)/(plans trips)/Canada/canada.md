Check your eTA status

    A final decision has been reached      Approved 
    eTA number      J523562232
    Expiry date     2028/04/23

    When you travel to Canada you will need to present the passport you used to apply for your eTA to the airline check-in staff. They will use your passport details to verify your eTA status in the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) database. An eTA is linked to your passport. It is not a physical document.

    An eTA is valid for up to five years or until your passport expires, whichever comes first.

    Visitors to Canada are responsible for the cost of any healthcare services they require. Before you come to Canada, you should get health insurance.

Your application for an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) has been approved. You are now authorized to travel to Canada by air.

When you travel to Canada, you will need to bring the passport you used to apply for your eTA, as the eTA is electronically linked to it. Should you obtain a new passport, you will need to apply for a new eTA.

Airline check-in staff and the Canada Border Services Agency will have electronic access to your eTA status using your passport.

In the future, you can verify the status and expiration of your eTA by using the eTA Check Status Tool. To do this, you will need the eTA number noted above and details from the passport you used to apply for your eTA.
