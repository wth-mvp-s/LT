In Japan, December isn't the most popular month for fly fishing, especially if you are looking at traditional Tenkara fly fishing. The primary reason is the colder temperatures which can impact fish activity in the streams. Here are some considerations:

    Temperature Range in December: December is winter in Japan. The temperature varies depending on the region. In major cities like Tokyo, you can expect temperatures to range from around 3°C (37°F) to 12°C (54°F). In more mountainous regions or the northern island of Hokkaido, temperatures can be much colder, often dropping below freezing.

    Fish Activity: Fish, like trout, tend to be less active in colder water temperatures. This means they might feed less often and be less responsive to flies.

    River Accessibility: Some mountain streams may be difficult to access due to snow or icy conditions. Furthermore, some rivers or fishing spots may have seasonal restrictions to protect fish during their spawning season.

    Species: While trout might be less active, there are other species like the "Amago" or "Iwana" which might still be targeted. Some anglers also pursue species like "Yamame" in the winter months.

    Alternative Fishing: If you're set on fishing in December, you might consider coastal or deep-sea fishing trips, which can target different species unaffected by the colder freshwater temperatures.

MILLIONAIRE SECURITY 

    Private Jets: Many wealthy individuals own or charter private jets. This not only offers a luxury experience but also decreases time spent in public airports and minimizes exposure.

    Advanced Security Teams: Personal security or bodyguard detail is not uncommon. These professionals assess risks, pre-scout locations, and stay with the individual or family to ensure their safety.

    Secure Accommodations: Staying in luxury, well-secured hotels or resorts is standard. Some might even buy private residences around the world and invest in their security infrastructure.

    Background Checks: Before hiring staff or interacting with locals, background checks are sometimes done to ensure there's no known threat or history of crime.

    Travel Light and Low-key: Despite their wealth, some prefer to travel without displaying obvious signs of their wealth. This might mean traveling without flashy jewelry or dressing down.

    Secure Transportation: Armored vehicles, chauffeur services, or cars with tinted windows can be used for added safety and privacy.

    Technology: Using encrypted phones, VPNs for internet browsing, or devices that detect eavesdropping can help maintain privacy and security.

    Advance Planning: Often, routes and plans are made well in advance, and there are backup plans in place. This ensures that there's always a secure way to move or escape if necessary.

    Avoiding Publicity: Some wealthy individuals prefer not to announce or publicize their travel plans. This reduces the likelihood of unwanted attention.

    Emergency Evacuation Plans: Having a plan in place for quick evacuations, whether it's due to a natural disaster, political unrest, or a personal threat, is essential.

    Medical Precautions: This might include traveling with a personal doctor, having access to medical evacuation services, or even carrying specific medicines or equipment.

    Cultural Sensitivity: Understanding and respecting local customs and behaviors is crucial. It helps in blending in and not drawing unnecessary attention.

    Regular Training: Some high-net-worth individuals and their families undergo training sessions in personal security, evasion techniques, or even self-defense.

    Networking: Being in touch with local influential figures, authorities, or other high-net-worth individuals can provide an added layer of security and information about potential threats or safe zones.
