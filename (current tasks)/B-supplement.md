B-Complex: 
 B1 (thiamine), 
 B2 (riboflavin), 
 B3 (niacin), 
 B5 (pantothenic acid), 
 B6 (pyridoxine),

Nutergia: Known for their high-quality supplements, including B vitamins.
Solgar: An international brand recognized for its quality, Solgar offers a range of B vitamins, including both complex and individual forms.

best: 

worst:
Less Bioavailable: Cyanocobalamin. While this synthetic form of B12 is still used in many supplements because it's stable and cost-effective, the body must convert it into methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin before it can be used, which may reduce its overall bioavailability for some individuals.
More Bioavailable: Methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin.
Vitamin B9 (Folate):

Less Bioavailable: Folic acid, especially in large amounts. Folic acid is the synthetic form of vitamin B9 and is commonly added to fortified foods and many supplements. Some individuals (especially those with a MTHFR genetic mutation) have difficulty converting folic acid to its active form, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF).
More Bioavailable: 5-MTHF (often labeled as L-methylfolate in supplements).
Minerals:

Minerals, such as iron, zinc, calcium, and magnesium, have various forms, with some being more bioavailable than others. For instance:
Iron: Ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, and ferrous fumarate are commonly used in supplements, but their bioavailability and tolerance can vary.
Calcium: Calcium carbonate is less bioavailable than calcium citrate but is more commonly found in supplements because of its cost-effectiveness.
Other Factors Impacting Bioavailability:

Nutrient source: Plant-based sources of certain nutrients, like iron, may be less bioavailable than animal sources.
Presence of other compounds: Some compounds can enhance or inhibit the absorption of nutrients. For instance, vitamin C can increase iron absorption, while phytates in grains can decrease it.
Gut health: Conditions like celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and atrophic gastritis can reduce the absorption of nutrients.
