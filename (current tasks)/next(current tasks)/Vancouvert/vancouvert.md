# choix horaire 
    Choose a Flight That Arrives in the Evening: Try to book a flight that arrives in the early evening local time and stay up until at least 10 pm in the local time zone on the day you arrive. This can help your body adjust more quickly to the new time zone.

    Adjust Your Schedule Before You Leave: Start adjusting your schedule a few days before you leave. If you're traveling westward, like from Paris to Canada, try to go to bed and wake up an hour later each day for a few days before your departure.

    Stay Hydrated: Dehydration can exacerbate the symptoms of jet lag, so drink plenty of water before, during, and after your flight.

    Move Around During the Flight: If itâ€™s a long flight, make sure to get up, stretch, and move around periodically. This can help reduce feelings of fatigue upon arrival.
