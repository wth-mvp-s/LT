    Protein Content: You've already pointed this out. Ideally, you'd want a high percentage of protein per 100g. Most high-quality whey protein isolates will have around 90g (or more) of protein per 100g.

    Sugar Content: A lower sugar content is generally preferable, especially if you're watching your carbohydrate intake or are concerned about added sugars. Check the ingredient list for names like sucrose, fructose, or other sugar-related terms.

    Fat Content (Matière Gras): A lower fat content is generally desirable for those looking to reduce calorie intake. However, some sources of fat can be beneficial (like omega-3s).

    Amino Acid Profile: Look for a complete amino acid profile, especially the BCAAs (Branched-Chain Amino Acids) – leucine, isoleucine, and valine – which are particularly important for muscle recovery and growth.

    Additives and Fillers: Check the ingredients list for unnecessary fillers, artificial colors, and preservatives. A cleaner ingredient list is generally preferable.

    Digestive Enzymes: Some whey protein products contain added digestive enzymes like lactase and protease to aid in digestion and reduce potential bloating or discomfort.

    Taste and Mixability: While this might seem superficial, the flavor and how easily the protein powder mixes in liquids can affect your overall experience. Some proteins can be very clumpy or have an off-putting taste.

    Price and Brand Reputation: Consider the cost per serving and the reputation of the brand. Reading reviews and doing some research can help you find a reliable product that offers value for money.

    Certifications: Look for certifications that matter to you. For instance, if you're concerned about harmful substances, a product certified by third-party organizations (like NSF or Informed Choice) ensures it doesn't contain banned or harmful substances.

    Lactose Content: If you're lactose intolerant, you'd want to lean towards a whey protein isolate over concentrate, as the isolate form has much of the lactose removed.
