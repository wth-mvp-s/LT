Layering (Glazing): One of Rembrandt's most well-known techniques is his use of transparent layers or glazes. He would start with a monochromatic underpainting and, once it was dry, apply thin, transparent layers of colored oil on top. This layering technique added depth to his paintings and allowed light to pass through multiple layers, which gave a luminous effect to the final work.

Impasto: This is the technique of laying paint thickly onto the canvas so that it stands out from the surface. Rembrandt often used impasto to render highlighted areas such as jewelry, embroidery, or the texture of fabrics, adding a three-dimensional quality to the surface.

Chiaroscuro: Rembrandt was a master of chiaroscuro, a technique that involves the use of strong contrasts between light and dark to create volume in modeling three-dimensional forms. This not only gave a dramatic effect to his paintings but also brought focus to specific elements in the composition.

Limited Palette: While Rembrandt's palette was quite broad over his lifetime, he often used a limited selection of colors in individual works. Earthy tones, such as umbers and siennas, were frequent choices, creating a warm and harmonious effect.

Texture Variation: Rembrandt was also known for his ability to vary the texture of his paint application, from very thin layers in shadowed areas to thick, textured applications in highlights. This variation added depth and interest to his works.

Ground Color: The ground (or underlayer) is the first layer of paint applied to a canvas, and it sets the tone for subsequent layers. Rembrandt often used a middle-toned ground, which allowed him to build up shadows and highlights effectively.
