Fundamental Questions (Test basic knowledge and understanding)

- Can you explain what an IP address is?
    
    [Internet Protocol], is unique device id on the network
        - internet browsing
        - email communication
        - local network communication

    IPv4 - four time number between 0-255, separated by dots
        192.0.2.53 

        total number of possible IPv4 addresses, 256^4


    IPv6 - EIGHT sets of numbers seperated by colons
        2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, 16bit value x 8 = 128bit

#        the "6" in "IPv6" primarily denotes the version of the protocol rather than the number of sets.
    
            estimated number of atoms on Earth (1.33 x 10^50) is significantly smaller than the number of possible IPv6 addresses.

            stars 20^24 smaller than ipv6

    int - 32bit value, -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 two billion

What are the differences between HTTP and HTTPS?
    HTTP - 1991 in swiss nuclear center, by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, can be easily intercepted
    HTTPS - same pattern plus encryption/decryption layer between the two. 
    
        This encryption layer ensures that only the server can decrypt the data sent by the client and vice versa.



What is the purpose of DNS in a network?
Can you explain the differences between TCP and UDP?
What do you understand by the term 'cloud computing'?
Intermediate Questions (Test ability to apply knowledge)

How would you handle a situation where a server is running slowly?

## this is the interview question i was asking severals candidates, How would you handle a situation where a server is running slowly? I want a list of key words which has to be part of correct solution, i want solution as list of task to accomlish the solution, in brief phrases, i want alternatives, what to not to do , i want technical reasoning explaining this issue, in details, 

How would you handle a situation where a server is running slowly?
    monitoring 
        CPU - poorly optimized application or a malware-infected process
        memory 
        disk space
        Network issues
        outdated server software or unpatched security vulnerabilities 
         inefficient code or database queries

    solutions
        load balancing and caching can help mitigate these issues by distributing the server load and reducing the number of requests to the server, respectively. 
        
        Upgrading server hardware or adding more servers can be an effective solution when the current setup is unable to handle the demand. 

    what not to do:

        Don't immediately assume it's a hardware issue and impulsively upgrade the server.
        Avoid making untested changes to the live server; use a development or staging environment.
        Don't ignore the possibility of a code-level or database issue; always check these areas.
        Avoid dismissing the role of network conditions in server performance.

Can you explain how a VPN works and why it might be used?
What steps would you take to secure a server?
What is load balancing, and why is it important?
Can you explain how virtualization works?
Advanced Questions (Test in-depth knowledge and expertise)

Can you describe a situation where you've had to troubleshoot a network problem?
Can you explain what happens when you type a URL into a browser?
How would you set up a scalable and reliable database system?
How would you deal with a DDOS attack?
What experience do you have with managing and implementing cybersecurity measures?
Expert Questions (Test mastery and understanding of nuances)

Can you explain how containerization differs from virtualization and the advantages it offers?
What steps would you take to diagnose and fix a performance issue in a cloud environment?
How would you handle a data breach?
How would you design a disaster recovery plan for an IT infrastructure?
Can you discuss some of the limitations and challenges of using microservices architecture?

# How I shouden been start preparation of Microsoft Certification (4next time notes:)

- what is az400 all about ? 
    tools like Azure DevOps, Git, Jenkins, and Azure Resource Manager.
    area like 
        continuous integration, merging code 
        continuous delivery, automatic deployment
        IaaS infrastructure as code, provisioning infrastructure

ADDITIONAL TOPICS TO GO IN DETAILS

On the other hand, HTTPS, the secure variant of HTTP, addresses these security issues by encrypting the data transferred between the user's browser and the server. This encryption is handled by either SSL or TLS protocols. HTTPS requires a valid SSL/TLS certificate, which is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority after verifying the authenticity of the website.

Port 443
    Any web server running on HTTPS will listen for requests on Port 443.
    Data transferred via Port 443 is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols.

Certificate Authority (CA)
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
Transport Layer Security (TLS)
SSL/TLS
