    [Internet Protocol], is unique device id on the network
        - internet browsing

    IPv4 - FOUR sets of number, separated by dots
        192.0.2.53 (0-255)

        total number of possible IPv4 addresses, 256^4


    IPv6 - EIGHT sets of numbers seperated by colons
        2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, 16bit value x 8 = 128bit

#        the "6" in "IPv6" primarily denotes the version of the protocol rather than the number of sets.
    
            estimated number of atoms on Earth (1.33 x 10^50) is significantly smaller than the number of possible IPv6 addresses.

            stars 20^24 smaller than ipv6
