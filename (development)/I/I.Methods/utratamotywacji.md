    they don't actually want that thing at all, 
    they just think they do, 
    OR 
    they're completely in love with the fantasy of that thing, 
    not the actuality of that thing. 
    OR 
    they do want it, 
    but are simply not choosing 
    any of the thorns that come with it. 
        In other words, they've decided on a subconscious level, 
        that they don't want it enough, 
        becouse the cost is not worth the benefit.
