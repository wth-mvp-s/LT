In the Composition API with Vue 2 (or even Vue 3), the order in which you define reactive references, computed properties, methods, or watchers inside the `setup()` function doesn't matter from a functional standpoint. However, it's a good idea to follow a consistent structure for better readability and maintainability.

A common convention you might consider is:

1. Reactive references (`ref` or `reactive`)
2. Computed properties (`computed`)
3. Methods (plain functions in the context of `setup()`)
4. Watchers (`watch` or `watchEffect`)

For example:

```javascript
import { ref, computed, watch } from '@vue/composition-api';

export default {
  setup() {
    // 1. Reactive references
    const count = ref(0);
    const message = ref('Hello');

    // 2. Computed properties
    const doubledCount = computed(() => count.value * 2);

    // 3. Methods
    const increment = () => {
      count.value++;
    };

    const displayMessage = () => {
      console.log(message.value);
    };

    // 4. Watchers
    watch(count, (newVal, oldVal) => {
      console.log(`Count changed from ${oldVal} to ${newVal}`);
    });

    // Expose to template
    return {
      count,
      doubledCount,
      increment,
      displayMessage
    };
  }
};
```

While this is a convention, remember that it's flexible. You can adopt whatever order or structure makes the most sense for your team and project. The important thing is to maintain consistency.
