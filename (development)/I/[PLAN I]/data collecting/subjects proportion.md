Work-Related Tasks (Protein - 15%): This includes work research, CV preparation, and oral answer preparation. Since proteins are essential but needed in moderation, dedicating 15% of your time to these tasks seems appropriate. This could translate to about 2.4 hours in a 16-hour waking day.

Art (Carbohydrates - 45%): Since carbohydrates are your main energy source, dedicating a significant portion of your time to art, which fuels your passion and creativity, is analogous. This means about 7.2 hours in a 16-hour day could be devoted to your art.

Musculation (Exercise - A Part of Fiber - 17.5%): Fiber is essential for health, and exercise is a crucial component of a healthy lifestyle. Allocating about half of the 'fiber' time to exercise would mean about 2.8 hours per day.

Socializing/Looking for a Partner (Social Fiber - Another Part of Fiber - 17.5%): The other half of your 'fiber' time could go towards socializing and looking for a partner. This also means about 2.8 hours per day.
