# Updating Remote Branch Name:
```git branch -m new-branch-name```
If the branch you renamed has already been pushed to a remote repository, you'll need to delete the old branch on the remote and push the new one. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

- Delete the old branch on the remote
```git push origin --delete old-branch-name```

- Push the new branch to the remote
```git push origin new-branch-name```

- Reset the upstream branch for the new branch name
```git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/new-branch-name new-branch-name```

- __It's a good practice to communicate such changes to your team members.__
