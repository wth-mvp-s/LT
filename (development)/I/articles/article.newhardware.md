        Motherboard
        For the motherboard, make sure to pick one that matches your case size. There are many Mini ITX motherboards that support Intel's i9 CPUs and have two slots for DDR4 memory.

        For storage, consider a 1TB or 2TB NVMe M.2 SSD. They are significantly faster than traditional SSDs and don't require extra cables, which is great for a small form factor build.

        For the power supply, you can get a small form factor (SFX) PSU. These are smaller than regular ATX power supplies, but still provide enough power for high-end components. 600-700W should be enough for this build.

        For cooling, consider a high-quality air cooler or an all-in-one liquid cooler. Be sure to check the cooler height to make sure it fits in your chosen case. Brands like Noctua and Be Quiet! are known for their high performance and quiet operation.

        Finally, you don't necessarily need a dedicated graphics card
