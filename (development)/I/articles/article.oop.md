        ADT Abstract Data Type
             is a composite of data along with the definition of all legal operations that access it.
            
            Protection (integrity): The interface should be understood as a hermetic border. The user should know exactly what an ADT does, but not how to do it.

            principle of protection (also known as encapsulation) is aimed at maintaining the integrity of the data and the methods that operate on that data.
I
    derived classes, inherit attributes and behavior
    Derived classes can also add and override methods and properties from the base class.
E
    protect internal structure of the data. from being accessed directly by the outside code.
        prevent accidentally deleting or changing data or making programming errors.
        
P
    interface let general class of actions. method in a class that behaves slightly differently in a subclass - the same method name, but with different underlying implementation.

Modularity
    safe programming and easy exchange of program parts. 
    When troubleshooting, individual modules can be viewed in a very isolated manner.
    Many improvements can be subsequently adopted via ADTs without the slightest change in all environment or application programs.
