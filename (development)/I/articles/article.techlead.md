#   lead developer, look for
        Functionality: work as expected? fulfill requirements?
        Code Quality: best practices followed?
        Error Handling
        Testing: 
            Has the developer written tests for their code? Even if there is no formal testing suite in place, they could write basic checks or provide a testing plan. A good developer understands the importance of testing.
        Documentation: 
            Has the developer documented their work? This could include inline comments in the code, as well as updating the project's documentation to reflect changes they made.
        Efficiency: 
        Integration: with the existing codebase?
        Version Control: 
            How does the developer use version control (like Git)? Do they make small, frequent commits with clear messages, or do they make large, infrequent commits?

#   Clarity of Roles and Responsibilities

    Definition: 
    Tech Lead 
        technical quality
    Manager
        resource performance, team productivity.

    Critics: this separation can create communication gaps.
    
#   Effective Communication
        Listen
        
            Tech Leads need to clearly articulate technical strategies, trade-offs, and mentor team members. 
            Managers need to communicate project status, team performance, expectations, and feedback effectively.

    Problem Solving: 
        Tech Lead
            prevent misunderstandings
        Manager
            team stays, on track, valued.
