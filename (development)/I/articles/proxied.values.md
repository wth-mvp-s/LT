Accessing Nested Data: When you use a computed property to access a nested object or array, and that data is reactive (like a Vuex state), Vue wraps the data in a Proxy to track changes. This is normal and expected.

Vue DevTools: The Vue DevTools should show the raw data, not the proxied version. If the Vue DevTools is showing an empty object for the board, it might be because of some issue with the DevTools version or a compatibility problem. You can try updating the Vue DevTools or using it in a different browser to see if that resolves the issue.

Rendering in the Template: Even if the console.log shows a Proxy, Vue should be able to render the data in your template. Given that the data is there (but proxied), you should be able to loop through board in your template without issues.

#    The best thing to do is to avoid nested structures. This is an established pattern in other global state single state tree systems like redux as well. But no need for Redux here. Normalizing the data is a good idea, yes - and the patterns that are used in redux for this stuff are applicble to vuex as well.


Vue's reactivity system, which wraps objects with proxies to make them reactive.

    In Vue 2.x, the reactivity system uses "observers" and "dep" tracking to achieve reactivity. This means when you look at a reactive object in the console, you'll see these extra properties (__ob__ and others). In Vue 3, the reactivity system was re-written to use ES6 Proxies, but the principle is similar.

-       Here's how you can handle this:

            Accessing Proxied Arrays: If grid is indeed an array but has been proxied by Vue's reactivity system, you should still be able to treat it as an array in most cases, with the usual array methods and properties like length, forEach, etc. If it's behaving like an object, it's possible something has transformed it from its original array structure.

            Convert Proxy to Raw Object: If for some reason you need to access the raw (unproxied) version of an object in Vue 3, you can use the toRaw function:

            javascript
            Copy code
            import { toRaw } from 'vue';

            const rawGrid = toRaw(grid);
            For Vue 2, the process is different since Vue 2 doesn't use Proxies. You'd likely need to create a deep clone of the object to bypass the reactivity.

            Iterating over Proxied Object: If grid is not behaving like an array, but you still want to iterate over its keys, you can use Object.keys or a for...in loop:

            javascript
            Copy code
            Object.keys(grid).forEach(key => {
                const row = grid[key];
                // Now, you can iterate over `row` if it's an array
            });
            Review Code: Review the parts of your code that handle or manipulate the grid data to ensure that it's not being unintentionally transformed into an object.

            Use Vuex State Properly: When working with Vuex, always ensure that state mutations are done via defined mutation handlers and not directly. Direct mutations can sometimes lead to issues with reactivity.

            If you're facing this issue due to Vue's reactivity system, understanding how Vue proxies data and how to properly access and modify reactive data is crucial. As a next step, you might want to verify how and where the grid data is being set and ensure it's correctly initialized as an array and maintained in that structure throughout its lifecycle.
