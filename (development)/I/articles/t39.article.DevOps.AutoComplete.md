#   Keeping commit history and the (PR) history as similar as possible is a good practice. 
        Benefits:
            Clear, Traceable, Simple Code Reviews.
            Revert and Cherry-Pick Simplified.

    When following a process of rebasing your feature branch with the main to align your commit history with your pull request (PR) history, it makes sense to choose a 
    SEMI-LINEAR MERGE strategy when completing your PR in DevOps.

#   Possible DevOps PR Merge-Types:

    -   Merge (no fast forward):
            Cons:
                - Merge conflicts possible when multiple branches worked simultaneously.
                - Main branch not always reflecting the working version of the product.    

            o---o            =>      o---o---------o'
             \                        \           / 
              \-o'---o'                \-o'---o'-/      

    -   Squash Commit (deleting the source branch when squashing is recommended).
        
            o---o           =>       o---o---o'  
             \                                 
              \-o'---o'              
            
    -   Rebase and fast-forward

            o----o           =>      o---o---o'---o' 
             \                                  
              \--o'---o'               

    -   Semi-linear merge
            Pro: 
                - Safe Collaboration
            
            o----o----o        =>    o---o---o--------------o' 
             \                                \            /
              \--o'---o'                       \--o'---o'-/


    Consider Hybrid approach:
        - Semi-linear merge: for feature branches and pull requests for critical changes or when collaboration and code quality are essential.
        - Direct merges: for simpler, low-risk changes.
