In fact I would rather make this interview in english, 
quite often I am asked about my english, when in fact later on I will never use it. 

Funny thing is the people who ask you about english, has their own crappy accent, 

but I hope I could prouve to you I am profetionally proficient. 
Programming in .NET Angular, I am used to complex environment,  
Since 2016 I ve seen everything what can be done, au niveau de fomulaire
with focus on performance and security

The question is, what are you looking for from this interview. 
And Could you tell what kind of person are you looking for. 
I can assure you I am a hard worker, quickly working, and having very wide stack of skills. 
La reste depends de Vous.
