# Example 1: A function that accepts another function as an argument

    function HOFgreet(name: string, formatFunction: (name: string) => string): string {
        return formatFunction(name);
    }

    function upperCaseName(name: string): string {
        return name.toUpperCase();
    }

    console.log(HOFgreetgreet("Alice", upperCaseName)); // ALICE

CRUCIAL.
   Ensuring that functions passed to HOFs do not modify external state is crucial.

# Example 2: A function that returns a function

                                                                            //      () - The parentheses here indicate a function type.
                                                                            //      => - This arrow in the context of the type indicates that we are defining a function
                                                                            //      type. It doesn't mean a function implementation, but rather describes the type.
                                                                                    
                                                                            //      number - After the =>, this represents the return type of the function.
function HOFmultiplier(factor: number): (num: number) => number {           
        return (num) => num * factor;
    }

    const twice = HOFmultiplier(2);
    console.log(twice(5)); // 10


## Higher-order functions that return other functions might seem abstract at first, but they have several practical use-cases. Let's discuss a few scenarios where returning a function can be useful:

1. Function Factories: As shown in the multiplier example, you can produce families of similar functions. Another common example is generating event handlers for UI elements. Imagine you have multiple buttons and each should have a slightly different behavior, but most of the logic is shared. A factory function can be the solution.

2. Closures and Data Encapsulation: By leveraging closures, you can create private data. This is a way to simulate private methods and properties in older versions of JavaScript:

```
function counter() {
    let count = 0;
    return {
        increment: function() { count++; return count; },
        decrement: function() { count--; return count; }
    };
}

const myCounter = counter();
myCounter.increment(); // 1
```

Here, you cannot directly access the count variable from outside, but you can modify it using the returned functions.

3. Middleware and Decorators: In frameworks like Express.js for Node.js, middleware functions often return other functions to handle incoming requests:

```
function loggingMiddleware(options) {
    return function(req, res, next) {
        console.log(`Request received at ${new Date()}`);
        next();
    };
}

app.use(loggingMiddleware({verbose: true}));

```

The outer function configures the middleware, while the inner function actually handles each request.

4. Partial Application and Currying: Partial application is the process of fixing a number of arguments for a function, producing another function of smaller arity. It's a technique to transform a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that take a single argument:

```
function add(x) {
    return function(y) {
        return x + y;
    };
}

const add5 = add(5);
add5(3);  // returns 8

```

This can be extremely useful in scenarios where you want to create specialized versions of a more general function.

5. Lazy Evaluation: Sometimes you want to delay the computation until it's really needed. Returning a function allows you to encapsulate the logic and run it later:

```
function expensiveComputation() {
    return function() {
        // Some heavy computation here...
        return result;
    };
}

const lazyEval = expensiveComputation();
// ... later in the code
const result = lazyEval();  // Now the computation happens

```

_While it's true that not every application or scenario requires returning functions, the pattern is a staple in functional programming and can offer elegant solutions to certain problems. It's just another tool in your programming toolkit, and understanding when to use it comes with experience and exposure to various coding challenges._
