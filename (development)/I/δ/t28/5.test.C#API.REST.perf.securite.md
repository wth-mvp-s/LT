- [ ] It allows the action methods to return multiple values.
- [ ] None of the above.

#### 015::In Entity Framework, what does the term 'lazy loading' mean?
- [x] It's a concept where navigation properties are loaded automatically when the property is accessed for the first time.

- [ ] It's a process where the properties of an entity are never loaded until explicitly asked for.
- [ ] None of the above.

#### 016::What does the "virtual" keyword do in Entity Framework?
- [x] It enables lazy loading for that property.

- [ ] By disabling authentication.
- [ ] None of the above.

#### 021::What is one benefit of using asynchronous programming in ASP.NET Core?
- [x] It can improve scalability by freeing up the thread to take on other requests while waiting for a task to complete.
- [ ] It increases the amount of memory used by the application.
- [ ] It decreases the number of requests that can be handled simultaneously.
- [ ] None of the above.

#### 022::How can you handle errors globally in ASP.NET Core?
