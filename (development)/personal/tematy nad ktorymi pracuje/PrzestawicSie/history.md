> Probably in the major Catholic cemetery in Plock. Your great great grandfather was part of a land owning family whose history in the area probably goes back many hundreds of years. He was friends with Prince Radzwill’s family according to my grandfather. The Radzwills lived on the opposite side of the Vistula. If you had been with us Sue and I would have talked to the numerous Kolodziejskis she located through Google who are still living in Plock and most likely related through my Grandfather’s three brothers, the ones captured by the Nazis and one by the Russians whose ultimate fate we never learned. Say hello to your Mom and Dad and your sweet sister. Ciao!
