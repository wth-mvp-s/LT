traktuj czas jak pieniadz

zawsze focus, coherence, to reach new reality new dimension    
    wrazliwosc of work from,     lzy w oczach i drzacy glos
    respect kochaj 
    
    when go hard take it easy
    nie sluchaj innych zwierzat 
    
nie pekaj na robocie

nie przebywac z looserami
Eviter magic the gathering 
la petite boite, reflechir to agir. 







Alpha (Α, α) and Omega (Ω, ω): In philosophy, these two letters are often used metaphorically to signify the beginning and the end, respectively, especially in religious or metaphysical discussions. They originate from the biblical phrase "I am the Alpha and the Omega," meaning God is eternal, spanning the beginning and end of time.

Phi (Φ, φ): This symbol is often used in philosophy to represent the golden ratio, a concept of perfect balance and beauty. It's also used in symbolic logic and philosophy of mind to denote "generic" or "unspecified" functions or actions.

Psi (Ψ, ψ): This symbol is used in philosophy of mind, particularly in discussions around consciousness and psychology (which gets its name from the Greek word "psyche").

Delta (Δ, δ): While more common in the sciences, this letter is used in philosophy to denote change.

Sigma (Σ, σ): This symbol is used to represent 'sum' in mathematics, and by extension, it can be used philosophically to discuss concepts of totality, accumulation, or completeness.

Epsilon (Ε, ε): In the philosophy of mathematics, epsilon is often used to represent a small quantity, approaching zero but never quite reaching it.

Lambda (Λ, λ): In philosophy, lambda is often associated with the concept of anonymity, but it's also used in logic and computer science (lambda calculus).
