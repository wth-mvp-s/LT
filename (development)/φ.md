Phi (φ) 

Physics and Mathematics: represents angles or phases, golden ratio, an irrational number approximately equal to 1.618, which has unique mathematical properties and appears in various aspects of art, architecture, and nature.

Computer Science: In algorithms and pseudocode, Phi is often used to denote an empty set or null.

Philosophy: functions in predicate logic, and also sometimes used to represent generic or unspecified functions.

Psychology: denote the normal cumulative distribution function.

    Physics and Mathematics: Lowercase phi (φ) is often used for phase angles, work functions, or other scalar quantities. The uppercase Phi (Φ) can represent fluxes (like electric flux or magnetic flux), or cumulative distribution functions in statistics.

    Computer Science: Both lowercase and uppercase Greek letters are often used to denote different types of sets or variables, depending on the context. There isn't a strict rule, it depends on the conventions used by the author.

    Philosophy: The conventions can vary widely, as Greek letters are often used to represent arbitrary or unspecified variables or functions. However, uppercase Greek letters (like Φ) are sometimes used for sets or classes, while lowercase Greek letters (like φ) are used for individual elements or functions.

    Psychology: Lowercase phi (φ) is often used in statistics for the correlation ratio. The uppercase Phi (Φ) can represent the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution in statistics.
