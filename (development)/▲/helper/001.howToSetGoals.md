Goals can vary based on your current fitness level, 
your long-term aspirations, 
and other personal considerations. 

steps to set short-term and long-term goals in muscle building:

    Step 1: Assess your current fitness level and define your long-term goals
    Consider factors such as your current weight, muscle mass, and strength levels. Then, identify your long-term goals. For instance, are you looking to gain a certain amount of muscle mass, achieve a certain physique, or reach specific strength levels?

    Step 2: Make your goals S.M.A.R.T
    S.M.A.R.T. stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

    Specific: Instead of saying "I want to get stronger," say "I want to increase my bench press weight by 20kg."

    Measurable: Make sure your goal is quantifiable, e.g., "I want to gain 5kg of lean muscle."

    Achievable: Your goals should be challenging yet possible to achieve within the time frame.

    Relevant: The goal should align with your broader fitness ambitions.

    Time-bound: Set a deadline for your goal, e.g., "I want to achieve this within six months."

    Step 3: Break down your long-term goals into short-term goals
    Your long-term goals may seem daunting, and breaking them down into smaller, short-term goals can make the process more manageable and give you a sense of progress along the way. For instance, if your long-term goal is to gain 12 kg of muscle in a year, you might break this down into a short-term goal of gaining 1 kg of muscle per month.

    Step 4: Develop a plan
    Develop a workout and nutrition plan that will help you achieve your short-term goals. This plan should include a balanced workout routine focusing on different muscle groups, as well as a protein-rich diet to support muscle growth.

    Step 5: Monitor your progress
    Track your progress towards your short-term goals regularly. You can do this through methods such as body composition analysis, strength benchmarks, or progress photos.

    Step 6: Adjust as necessary
    Based on your progress, you may need to adjust your goals or plan. It's okay if you don't meet a goal in the expected timeframe; the key is to learn from the experience and adjust your approach as needed.

Remember, everyone's body is different and responds differently to exercise and nutrition. It may take some time to find what works best for you. Always consult a fitness professional or a doctor if you're unsure about anything, and 

don't forget to take care of your mental health as well during your fitness journey.
