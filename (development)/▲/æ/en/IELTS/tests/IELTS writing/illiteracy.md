The graph depict the data from the last year. 
We can read the pourcentage of illiteraccy by region for both the male and female. 
The illiteracy as fenomene in a world wide scale does not occurs in more then 55% of population. 
What is significant to me, is the fact that disproportion is very significant by regions. 
We can easly make connection between illiteracy and the fact that countries are underdevelopped. 
From the graph the most important observation I would make is the fact that between the develloped countries and those who are underdevelopped, the diffirence in illiterracy goes between 10 to 50 times. 
Second most importand observation I would say is the fact that for majority of underdevelopped countries, the female are much more concerned about illiteracy, what it mean the sex agality is not respected in those countries. 
We can learn from this graph that the worst situation in sense of the illiteracy takes equally place in South Asia, Arab states and Sub-saharan Africa.
The situation is twice less important in East Asia/ Oceania nor South American/Caribean, but still at least 10 time more important then in developped countries. 
The sex agality in term of access to the education is at first look is very positive  in Latin American/Caribean though. 
I think this kind of graph giva us a lot to think about in terms of how big dirrifence they are in our contemporary word. 
When born in developped countries we may belive our world is very developped and there are a lot of progress in many fields, but it is as we saw here, not true for all of us. We live in a very unequal world where there is still a lot to do to improuve the quality of life of other people, to make our planet the better world.
