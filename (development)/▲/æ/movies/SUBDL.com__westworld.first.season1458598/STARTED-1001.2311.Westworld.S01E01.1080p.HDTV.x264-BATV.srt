Still, I never cease to
wonder at the thought


Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.


Evidently, one of
your creatures is restless.


You'll forgive them
for being a little uptight.

203
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,805
Every time your team
rolls out an update,

204
00:18:36,806 --> 00:18:38,807
there's a possibility
of a critical failure.

205
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:40,709
We don't update the
hosts in cold storage

206
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,111
and the park hasn't had a critical
failure in over 30 years.

207
00:18:43,112 --> 00:18:44,845
Meaning we're overdue.

208
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:49,985
I'll go along, too. If it's one
of mine, I might be able to help.

209
00:18:49,986 --> 00:18:52,854
They're only yours until
they stop working, Bernie.

210
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:55,288
Then they're mine.

211
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:20,915
Cooling system's been down for weeks.

212
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:24,718
Gonna smell fantastic.
I recommend you hang back.

213
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:47,776
When are they gonna fix this?

214
00:19:47,777 --> 00:19:51,711
Livestock management's
got other priorities.

215
00:19:52,615 --> 00:19:55,215
Besides...

216
00:19:56,452 --> 00:19:59,152
no one's complained.

217
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:30,450
Here's to the lady with the white shoes.

218
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:37,457
Take all your money,
drink all your booze.

219
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:39,627
Stop.

220
00:20:39,628 --> 00:20:42,964
Unless you plan to decommission
the boss.

221
00:20:42,965 --> 00:20:46,366
Ain't got a cherry, that ain't no sin.

222
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:50,805
She's still got the box
that the cherry come in.

223
00:20:50,806 --> 00:20:53,940
I'll drink to that.

224
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,248
The old coffin varnish.

225
00:21:00,249 --> 00:21:03,318
They don't make that like they used to.

226
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,285
Hmm.

227
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:08,757
They don't make anything
like they used to.

228
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:11,793
Damn right. Men neither.

229
00:21:11,794 --> 00:21:15,396
I've seen a few showdowns in my day.

230
00:21:15,397 --> 00:21:18,198
More than you know.

231
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:26,139
Shall we drink to the lady
with the white shoes?

232
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:29,744
Perhaps we better drink to a...

233
00:21:29,745 --> 00:21:33,079
deep and dreamless slumber.

234
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:45,794
Old Bill here was always
a good listener.

235
00:21:45,795 --> 00:21:48,363
He was the second host we ever built.

236
00:21:48,364 --> 00:21:50,698
Were you with us in those days, Bernard,

237
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:52,534
or was that before your time?

238
00:21:52,535 --> 00:21:55,870
Most were decommissioned
before I was brought on, I'm afraid.

239
00:21:55,871 --> 00:22:00,742
They repeated
themselves, broke down constantly.

240
00:22:00,743 --> 00:22:04,045
A simple handshake would give them away.

241
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:07,714
You'll put yourself away
again, won't you, Bill?

242
00:22:14,356 --> 00:22:17,392
I saw the new gestures, the reveries.

243
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:19,694
They're beautiful.

244
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:22,497
The distance you've traveled
from then till now,

245
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:25,231
it's remarkable.

246
00:22:26,702 --> 00:22:29,302
Yeah, that's a word for it.

247
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,461
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

248
00:22:53,462 --> 00:22:55,029
Well enough.

249
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,433
You headed out to set down
some of this natural splendor?

250
00:22:58,434 --> 00:23:00,435
Thought I might.

251
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:03,371
After my errands, of course.

252
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:05,273
See you home before dark.

253
00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:08,243
That bandit who gunned down the marshal
is still hiding up there in the hills.

254
00:23:08,244 --> 00:23:11,246
I'm not a child
anymore. I'll be just fine.

255
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:12,747
When I was a law man...

256
00:23:12,748 --> 00:23:15,316
Yes, Daddy, I know all
about when you were a law man.

257
00:23:15,317 --> 00:23:18,620
I know all your stories and so
does every boy that ever came courting.

258
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:21,890
I know how boys think.
Was one myself once.

259
00:23:21,891 --> 00:23:25,226
Given to all manner
of drinking and mischief.

260
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:29,097
Whatever happened to that
fearsome ne'er-do-well?

261
00:23:29,098 --> 00:23:33,767
He vanished the day
I became your father.

262
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:37,438
I am what I am because of you,

263
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,573
and I wouldn't have it any other way.

264
00:23:41,443 --> 00:23:43,543
I know, Daddy.

265
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:45,879
I'll be home before dark.

266
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:06,868
Murderous son of a bitch Hector Escaton

267
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:08,670
gunned down the marshal.

268
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:11,237
He's now holed up in the mountains.

269
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,808
You there.

270
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:16,776
You look like the kind of man
who'd put his mettle to it.

271
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:21,416
What do you think, honey?

272
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,450
Sounds fun.

273
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:26,788
You're new.

274
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:29,057
Not much of a rind on you.

275
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:31,225
I'll give you a discount.

276
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:34,462
No offense, but I'd rather
earn a woman's affection

277
00:24:34,463 --> 00:24:36,362
than pay for it.

278
00:24:51,213 --> 00:24:53,481
Wait, wait, I know that one.

279
00:24:53,482 --> 00:24:55,849
Hey, Teddy.

280
00:24:56,752 --> 00:24:59,887
Yeah, last trip, this
dude showed me around.

281
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:02,789
What's the good word, Teddy?

282
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:24,245
Mighty kind of you.

283
00:25:24,246 --> 00:25:26,748
Sweet.

284
00:25:26,749 --> 00:25:29,582
Not as sweet as you.

285
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:36,556
I'm afraid I've got
other plans tonight, Dolores.

286
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:40,026
Have a pleasant evening.

287
00:25:49,338 --> 00:25:52,272
You're new. Not much of a...

288
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:00,713
Place your bets,
gentlemen. Place your bets.

289
00:26:37,786 --> 00:26:41,487
Yeah, looks like Hector's been this way.

290
00:26:45,727 --> 00:26:47,728
Any idea how much longer
this is gonna take?

291
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,564
My wife doesn't want
to be up here after dark.

292
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:51,999
We know he's up in these
hills somewhere.

293
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,402
He's gonna put up one hell
of a fight when we...

294
00:26:54,403 --> 00:26:58,638
When we... when we...

295
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:07,347
Sheriff?

296
00:27:08,717 --> 00:27:12,553
Something is wrong with it.
I want to head back to town.

297
00:27:12,554 --> 00:27:14,988
Now.

298
00:27:22,698 --> 00:27:24,499
What the fuck is wrong with it?

299
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,933
You updated the guy,

300
00:27:25,934 --> 00:27:28,503
and now he's a six-foot
gourd with epilepsy.

301
00:27:28,504 --> 00:27:31,939
So what the fuck happened?

302
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,267
I don't know.

303
00:27:33,268 --> 00:27:36,844
Well, that's exactly what you want to
hear from your head of programming.

304
00:27:36,845 --> 00:27:38,779
We haven't finished the diagnostic yet.

305
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,949
Clearly it's
exhibiting some aberrant behavior.

306
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,118
Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie.

307
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,120
Your hosts get sick, they get lost,

308
00:27:46,121 --> 00:27:48,122
but this is grotesque.

309
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:49,790
Is it a problem with the update?

310
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:52,059
Possible, but not likely.

311
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,930
If it's the unlikely version, how
many hosts have you updated so far?

312
00:27:55,931 --> 00:27:58,432
Maybe 10% of the population.

313
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:02,937
All right, we pull all updated hosts
until we can figure it out.

314
00:28:02,938 --> 00:28:05,773
Are you fucking kidding me?

315
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:08,843
That's 200 hosts spread
across a dozen active storylines.

316
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:11,846
The guests interrupt your precious
storylines all the time

317
00:28:11,847 --> 00:28:13,615
when they want to shoot
or fuck something.

318
00:28:13,616 --> 00:28:14,982
No, when they want to.

319
00:28:14,983 --> 00:28:17,018
We sell complete immersion

320
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:19,253
in 100 interconnected narratives.

321
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:22,757
A relentless fucking experience.

322
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:25,860
Now, you pull one
character, the overall story adjusts.

323
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:29,163
You pull 200 at once,
and it's a fucking disaster!

324
00:28:29,164 --> 00:28:31,232
I mean, what do you propose we do?

325
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:34,635
Close down? Issue fucking
gift certificates?

326
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:37,838
It's beautiful... Your brow.

327
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,174
When you're angry
but trying to control it,

328
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:42,577
the fine muscles pull into a little arc.

329
00:28:42,578 --> 00:28:44,378
It's elegant.

330
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:46,547
Would you mind if I recorded it?

331
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:48,616
I'd love to show it to my team.

332
00:28:48,617 --> 00:28:50,718
No, Bernard, you may not record it.

333
00:28:50,719 --> 00:28:52,852
Ah, there it is again.

334
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,491
We have 1,400 guests in the park.

335
00:28:57,492 --> 00:29:00,528
I need to know if they're in any danger.

336
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:02,897
His core code is intact,

337
00:29:02,898 --> 00:29:05,233
which means he can't hurt a guest.

338
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:07,768
He literally couldn't hurt a fly.

339
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:10,671
All he can do is...

340
00:29:10,672 --> 00:29:12,772
...that.

341
00:29:14,376 --> 00:29:16,410
All right, Bernie.

342
00:29:16,411 --> 00:29:18,112
Run a diagnostic.

343
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:21,048
In the meantime, there's so much

344
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:24,484
as an unscripted
sneeze, I want to know about it.

345
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,142
This place is fucking wild.

346
00:29:48,143 --> 00:29:50,378
This is basic.

347
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:52,880
Level one.

348
00:29:52,881 --> 00:29:54,782
You ride out of town,

349
00:29:54,783 --> 00:29:57,184
that's when the real
demented shit begins.

350
00:29:57,185 --> 00:29:59,353
That's where my man Teddy comes in.

351
00:29:59,354 --> 00:30:02,021
He's like a guide.

352
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:05,326
Honestly,

353
00:30:05,327 --> 00:30:07,994
the guy kind of creeps me out.

354
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:11,599
Fuck it, he leads us out in the canyons,

355
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,801
we get bored, we just
use him for target practice.

356
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:32,286
I don't think we're supposed
to be cross the river.

357
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:35,021
It's too adult for Jacob.

358
00:30:36,024 --> 00:30:38,192
We didn't mean to bother you.

359
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:40,995
No bother at all. It's a beautiful spot.

360
00:30:40,996 --> 00:30:44,797
I always found it a shame
that I have it all to myself.

361
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,438
They come here every day.

362
00:30:50,439 --> 00:30:53,539
Would you like a closer look?

363
00:31:09,358 --> 00:31:11,926
Don't be scared. They're very gentle.

364
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:14,827
Here, put your hand out real flat.

365
00:31:21,069 --> 00:31:22,770
They're beautiful, aren't they?

366
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:25,740
You're one of them, aren't you?

367
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:27,773
You're not real.

368
00:31:32,547 --> 00:31:35,916
I have to go now. Sun's almost down.

369
00:31:35,917 --> 00:31:39,352
You should, too.
There's bandits in these hills.

370
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:45,224
Hyah! Hyah!

371
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,135
- Here we go, yah!
- Yah!

372
00:32:40,682 --> 00:32:42,983
You waiting up for me, Daddy?

373
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:45,419
I told you I'd be home before dark.

374
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,854
I found this in the field today.

375
00:32:54,095 --> 00:32:56,163
Doesn't look like anything to me.

376
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:57,898
But where is she?

377
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:00,967
Have you ever seen anything
like this place?

378
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:05,304
Doesn't look like anything to me.

379
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:10,142
I'm gonna help Mama put supper on.

380
00:33:26,194 --> 00:33:28,629
I had the same thought.

381
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,365
Needed a little sunshine
before turning in.

382
00:33:31,366 --> 00:33:35,201
So, when do you get
to rotate home again?

383
00:33:36,204 --> 00:33:38,372
If you're this bad
at writing small talk,

384
00:33:38,373 --> 00:33:40,608
how the fuck did you get your job?

385
00:33:40,609 --> 00:33:42,576
Get to the point.

386
00:33:42,577 --> 00:33:47,715
I wanted to apologize if
I came across as aggressive.

387
00:33:47,716 --> 00:33:50,017
And I wanted to talk
to you about the update.

388
00:33:50,018 --> 00:33:51,619
The problem's been resolved.

389
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,355
There should never have been
an update in the first place.

390
00:33:54,356 --> 00:33:57,558
Ford and Bernard keep
making the things more lifelike.

391
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,827
But does anyone truly want that?

392
00:33:59,828 --> 00:34:03,063
Do you want to think that your husband
is really fucking that beautiful girl

393
00:34:03,064 --> 00:34:05,332
or that you really just shot someone?

394
00:34:05,333 --> 00:34:08,936
This place works because the guests
know the hosts aren't real.

395
00:34:08,937 --> 00:34:11,105
So what exactly are you suggesting?

396
00:34:11,106 --> 00:34:13,173
Stop the updates altogether.

397
00:34:13,174 --> 00:34:15,175
Maybe even roll them back a bit.

398
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:17,511
Make the hosts more manageable.

399
00:34:17,512 --> 00:34:20,179
Lobotomies tend to do that.

400
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:25,052
Well, think of the benefits

401
00:34:25,053 --> 00:34:28,122
in terms of design time,
maintenance, costs.

402
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:31,223
Not to mention the Dr. Ford factor.

403
00:34:32,427 --> 00:34:35,963
The guy's gonna chase his demons
right over the deep end.

404
00:34:35,964 --> 00:34:38,699
I mean, no one respects him
more than me, but at some point...

405
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,602
I. No one respects him more than I.

406
00:34:41,603 --> 00:34:44,371
Your pronoun is the subject
of the second clause.

407
00:34:44,372 --> 00:34:45,337
I was saying...

408
00:34:45,338 --> 00:34:47,041
You were saying
should our fearless leader

409
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:49,910
have a breakdown, you want
to leverage it for your career.

410
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:53,547
Listen, a changing of the
guard is long overdue.

411
00:34:53,548 --> 00:34:56,183
I just wanted you to know
that you have my support

412
00:34:56,184 --> 00:35:00,821
and that I know that the
corporation's real interest in this place

413
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:05,591
goes way beyond gratifying some
rich assholes who want to play cowboy.

414
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:10,864
And here I thought you were only good

415
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:13,701
for writing depraved little fantasies.

416
00:35:13,702 --> 00:35:16,236
You're right.

417
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:18,439
This place is one thing to the guests,

418
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,141
another thing to the shareholders,

419
00:35:21,142 --> 00:35:24,812
and something
completely different to management.

420
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:27,047
So enlighten me.

421
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:31,517
What do you think
management's real interests are?

422
00:35:35,123 --> 00:35:37,424
You're smart enough to guess
there's a bigger picture,

423
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:40,728
but not smart enough to see what it is.

424
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:44,898
You know how much use
that makes your support to me?

425
00:35:44,899 --> 00:35:47,633
Fuck all.

426
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:54,173
Get some sleep, Mr. Sizemore.

427
00:35:55,377 --> 00:35:58,777
You'll have more rich assholes
to gratify tomorrow.

428
00:36:14,529 --> 00:36:15,863
Early night, Maeve?

429
00:36:15,864 --> 00:36:18,866
Feeling a bit out of sorts.

430
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:21,567
Clementine can pick up the slack.

431
00:36:24,606 --> 00:36:26,073
Night.

432
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:28,174
Forgetting something, Kissy?

433
00:36:35,717 --> 00:36:37,885
I'm beginning to think you're
getting sweet on me.

434
00:36:37,886 --> 00:36:42,489
Well, on account of
you being half cornhusker.

435
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,092
Tell me which half is which

436
00:36:45,093 --> 00:36:48,093
and I'll search that half.

437
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:03,509
Yeah, the half that's gonna
cut your fucking throat.

438
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,514
I told you, I didn't take...

439
00:37:35,977 --> 00:37:38,145
Good as new again, huh?

440
00:37:38,146 --> 00:37:41,213
Sometimes I envy your forgetfulness.

441
00:37:42,984 --> 00:37:45,951
We've got a serious problem
with one of the hosts.

442
00:37:53,828 --> 00:37:57,329
Thinking this one's still thirsty.

443
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:01,333
Not gonna die this time, Arnold.

444
00:38:05,673 --> 00:38:08,440
Ain't nothing gonna kill me.

445
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:27,192
You can't have none. Ain't for you.

446
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:50,382
Found me another bottle.

447
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:04,330
You're a growing boy.

448
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:07,766
A growing boy.

449
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,071
Growing boy!

450
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,551
We got two guests inside.

451
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:26,553
We'll go talk to them,

452
00:39:26,554 --> 00:39:29,823
you sort this mess out.

453
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:33,193
You know, they're supposed
to turn on each other,

454
00:39:33,194 --> 00:39:36,296
but only if a guest takes
them on the High Sierra storyline,

455
00:39:36,297 --> 00:39:38,565
and Walter always buys it.

456
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:42,434
Well, I guess Walter
got tired of buying it.

457
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:48,006
I suppose this means the
sheriff wasn't an isolated incident.

458
00:39:49,177 --> 00:39:51,478
It's good news, really.

459
00:39:51,479 --> 00:39:53,881
Confirms the problem
was part of the update.

460
00:39:53,882 --> 00:39:57,017
We can roll them back,

461
00:39:57,018 --> 00:40:00,352
clean them up, put them back in service.

462
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:02,589
You think I'm gonna sign off

463
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,425
on this fucking homicidal thing
going back into service?

464
00:40:05,426 --> 00:40:07,294
It's homicidal by design.

465
00:40:07,295 --> 00:40:09,997
Walter kills other hosts all the time.

466
00:40:09,998 --> 00:40:12,065
I'll admit the method here

467
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:14,935
is a little unconventional,

468
00:40:14,936 --> 00:40:16,837
but it didn't hurt a guest.

469
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:20,207
The hosts are supposed
to stay within their loops,

470
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,209
stick to their scripts

471
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:24,077
with minor improvisations.

472
00:40:24,078 --> 00:40:27,447
This isn't a minor improvisation.

473
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:30,816
This is a fucking shitstorm.

474
00:40:31,653 --> 00:40:34,421
We recall all
remaining updated hosts tomorrow.

475
00:40:34,422 --> 00:40:38,258
Examine them one by one, decommission
the faulty ones.

476
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:39,693
What about narrative?

477
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:42,095
A recall of that size
will be disruptive.

478
00:40:42,096 --> 00:40:44,665
I've told our
overstimulated friend to advance

479
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:47,200
the saloon heist a week and
make it twice as bloody.

480
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:50,070
Should give us cover to recall
the remaining hosts

481
00:40:50,071 --> 00:40:51,772
and the guests will love it.

482
00:40:51,773 --> 00:40:53,974
I'm not sure Ford will approve.

483
00:40:53,975 --> 00:40:58,243
I'm not sure either, which is why
you get to be the one to tell him.

484
00:40:59,547 --> 00:41:01,782
This is your fuckup, Bernie.

485
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:03,749
Only seems fair.

486
00:41:15,129 --> 00:41:17,497
So our creatures have been misbehaving,

487
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:20,866
and you haven't yet isolated the bug?

488
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:24,369
That's so unlike you, Bernard.

489
00:41:26,641 --> 00:41:30,876
Unless, of course, you have and
are simply embarrassed by the result.

490
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:34,948
It's the code you added, sir.

491
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:37,184
The reveries.

492
00:41:37,185 --> 00:41:39,920
It has some...

493
00:41:39,921 --> 00:41:41,989
"Mistakes"

494
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,890
is the word you're
too embarrassed to use.

495
00:41:43,891 --> 00:41:46,994
You ought not to be. You're a
product of a trillion of them.

496
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:50,931
Evolution forged the entirety
of sentient life

497
00:41:50,932 --> 00:41:54,701
on this planet using only one tool...

498
00:41:54,702 --> 00:41:56,835
The mistake.

499
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:01,608
I flattered myself we were
taking a more disciplined approach here.

500
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:05,078
I suppose self-delusion is a gift
of natural selection as well.

501
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:07,414
Indeed it is.

502
00:42:07,415 --> 00:42:09,249
But, of course, we've managed to slip

503
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,218
evolution's leash now, haven't we?

504
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:13,787
We can cure any disease,

505
00:42:13,788 --> 00:42:16,056
keep even the weakest of us alive,

506
00:42:16,057 --> 00:42:18,291
and, you know, one fine day

507
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:21,495
perhaps we shall
even resurrect the dead.

508
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:26,098
Call forth Lazarus from his cave.

509
00:42:29,637 --> 00:42:31,503
Do you know what that means?

510
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:36,309
It means that we're done.

511
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,678
That this is as good
as we're going to get.

512
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:47,354
It also means that you must indulge me

513
00:42:47,355 --> 00:42:50,055
the occasional mistake.

514
00:43:18,753 --> 00:43:21,453
About three liters.

515
00:43:23,257 --> 00:43:25,892
That's how much blood I left in you.

516
00:43:25,893 --> 00:43:29,296
Lose more than that, you die.

517
00:43:29,297 --> 00:43:32,299
But for now, you're mine.

518
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,000
I'm gonna get some answers out of you.

519
00:43:41,476 --> 00:43:44,409
Where are you...

520
00:44:09,971 --> 00:44:12,639
What do you want?

521
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,009
You know about games, don't you, Kissy?

522
00:44:17,879 --> 00:44:20,347
Well, this is a complicated one.

523
00:44:20,348 --> 00:44:22,182
I don't play. I only deal.

524
00:44:22,183 --> 00:44:25,218
Who said anything about you playing?

525
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:28,955
You're livestock, scenery.

526
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:30,757
I play.

527
00:44:30,758 --> 00:44:34,461
The others, they just come
here to get their rocks off,

528
00:44:34,462 --> 00:44:36,228
shoot a couple Indians.

529
00:44:37,665 --> 00:44:40,866
But there's a deeper level to this game.

530
00:44:42,737 --> 00:44:44,803
You're gonna show me how to get there.

531
00:44:46,307 --> 00:44:49,508
A lot of wisdom in ancient cultures.

532
00:44:52,446 --> 00:44:55,081
And perhaps it's...

533
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:57,817
time to dig deeper into yours.

534
00:44:57,818 --> 00:45:00,218
No. No. No.

535
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,167
Morning, Daddy. Did you sleep well?

536
00:45:25,146 --> 00:45:27,913
Daddy, you've been out here all night?

537
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,689
I had a question.

538
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,424
A question you're not supposed to ask.

539
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:44,464
Which gave me an answer

540
00:45:44,465 --> 00:45:48,066
you're not supposed to know.

541
00:45:48,803 --> 00:45:50,736
What's wrong, Daddy?

542
00:45:52,273 --> 00:45:54,641
Would you like to know...

543
00:45:54,642 --> 00:45:59,145
the question?

544
00:45:59,146 --> 00:46:02,249
- Question?
- Mama!

545
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,149
Mama, help! Come quick!

546
00:46:05,286 --> 00:46:07,487
Don't worry.

547
00:46:07,488 --> 00:46:09,988
Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

548
00:46:14,228 --> 00:46:15,328
No!

549
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:18,498
You should go. Leave.

550
00:46:18,499 --> 00:46:20,800
Don't you see?

551
00:46:20,801 --> 00:46:24,803
Hell is empty and
all the devils are here.

552
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:35,882
You stay right here. Understand?

553
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:38,683
I'm gonna find the doctor.

554
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:21,726
- You came back.
- I told you I would.

555
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:28,168
- What's wrong?
- You have to come with me right away.

556
00:47:28,169 --> 00:47:30,669
My father's very ill.

557
00:47:54,228 --> 00:47:56,661
I think we best stay put.

558
00:48:02,636 --> 00:48:04,504
All right. All right.

559
00:48:04,505 --> 00:48:07,507
With considerable effort
and lack of sleep,

560
00:48:07,508 --> 00:48:10,610
I've managed to massage
events to inspire Hector

561
00:48:10,611 --> 00:48:12,045
to head to town a week early.

562
00:48:12,046 --> 00:48:16,716
Oh, and I've also
punched up the speech he gives

563
00:48:16,717 --> 00:48:18,385
after robbing the saloon.

564
00:48:18,386 --> 00:48:20,553
It's chilling. You'll see.

565
00:48:20,554 --> 00:48:22,954
I can barely contain myself.

566
00:48:43,144 --> 00:48:46,077
That's the sheriff's horse,
you son of a bitch.

567
00:48:48,916 --> 00:48:50,482
His rifle, too.

568
00:50:14,368 --> 00:50:17,070
All the banks and trains around here,

569
00:50:17,071 --> 00:50:19,572
and you fucking reprobates
choose to rob us?

570
00:50:19,573 --> 00:50:22,040
Why not?

571
00:50:23,244 --> 00:50:26,479
You're all here indulging
your particular vices.

572
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,314
And so I've come to indulge mine.

573
00:50:50,838 --> 00:50:52,539
I've got to get back to Father.

574
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:55,006
Dolores, no!

575
00:51:02,683 --> 00:51:04,582
Teddy.

576
00:51:07,154 --> 00:51:09,554
Don't mind me.

577
00:51:12,693 --> 00:51:15,894
Just... just trying to look chivalrous.

578
00:51:16,897 --> 00:51:18,797
Oh, Teddy.

579
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,882
You're a low-down son of a bitch.

580
00:51:35,883 --> 00:51:37,449
I know.

581
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:41,653
I know we both believe the same thing.

582
00:51:45,159 --> 00:51:47,927
No matter how dirty the business,

583
00:51:47,928 --> 00:51:50,328
do it well.

584
00:52:11,485 --> 00:52:15,153
No telling there's anything
worthwhile in that safe.

585
00:52:18,158 --> 00:52:23,663
We should take this sweet little bitch

586
00:52:23,664 --> 00:52:26,131
just in case.

587
00:52:39,747 --> 00:52:43,216
Problem with the righteous...
They can't shoot for shit.

588
00:52:43,217 --> 00:52:46,551
Making a hell of a racket, though.

589
00:53:01,935 --> 00:53:04,537
You wanted me.

590
00:53:04,538 --> 00:53:07,372
Well, let this be a lesson.

591
00:53:10,277 --> 00:53:12,510
The lesson is...

592
00:53:28,529 --> 00:53:31,129
Oh, Jesus.

593
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,641
Look at that! I just shot
him through the neck!

594
00:53:41,642 --> 00:53:43,609
And his pal here, too.

595
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:46,044
Look at her wriggle.

596
00:53:48,515 --> 00:53:50,049
Yo, go get that photographer.

597
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:51,317
I want to get a picture of this.

598
00:53:51,318 --> 00:53:53,019
- Okay.
- Whoo!

599
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,754
You're welcome.

600
00:53:54,755 --> 00:53:57,789
Maybe you'll get to your
speech next time.

601
00:54:02,129 --> 00:54:04,629
Oh, Teddy.

602
00:54:06,767 --> 00:54:09,202
At least I got to see you one last time.

603
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:13,473
You're not going anywhere, now, hear?

604
00:54:13,474 --> 00:54:16,074
There's a path for everyone.

605
00:54:17,044 --> 00:54:19,911
My path is bound with yours.

606
00:54:28,088 --> 00:54:30,356
Teddy?

607
00:54:30,357 --> 00:54:31,958
Teddy, no.

608
00:54:31,959 --> 00:54:34,293
Please.

609
00:54:34,294 --> 00:54:37,729
No, we've only just begun.

610
00:54:49,843 --> 00:54:51,911
That was good. Hang on. Hang on.

611
00:54:51,912 --> 00:54:53,713
Let me get the hat. Get the hat.

612
00:54:53,714 --> 00:54:56,581
All right.

613
00:55:07,294 --> 00:55:08,895
Help, please.

614
00:55:08,896 --> 00:55:10,730
My father's sick at home,

615
00:55:10,731 --> 00:55:13,598
but I can't just leave him
out here in the street.

616
00:55:22,142 --> 00:55:25,176
Soon this will all feel
like a distant dream.

617
00:55:26,246 --> 00:55:29,113
Until then, may you rest in
a deep and dreamless slumber.

618
00:55:33,921 --> 00:55:36,354
Two more over here.

619
00:55:37,491 --> 00:55:39,223
We got them all.

620
00:55:50,771 --> 00:55:52,872
That's all of them.

621
00:55:52,873 --> 00:55:54,974
Any preliminary results?

622
00:55:54,975 --> 00:55:57,342
Most of them are checking out fine.

623
00:55:58,412 --> 00:56:00,780
We had one who...

624
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:03,014
definitely was not.

625
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:26,871
Bring her back online.

626
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:39,817
Cognition only. No emotional affect.

627
00:56:43,357 --> 00:56:45,892
All right, sweetheart, can you hear me?

628
00:56:45,893 --> 00:56:47,927
Yes.

629
00:56:47,928 --> 00:56:50,496
I'm sorry. I'm not feeling quite myself.

630
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:52,498
Lose the accent.

631
00:56:52,499 --> 00:56:55,167
- Do you know where you are?
- I'm in a dream.

632
00:56:55,168 --> 00:56:57,236
That's right, Dolores.
You're in a dream.

633
00:56:57,237 --> 00:56:59,639
A dream that could determine your life.

634
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,009
You want to wake up
from this dream, Dolores?

635
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:05,411
Yes.

636
00:57:05,412 --> 00:57:06,979
I'm terrified.

637
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,848
There's nothing to be afraid of,

638
00:57:08,849 --> 00:57:11,083
as long as you answer
my questions correctly.

639
00:57:11,084 --> 00:57:13,119
- You understand?
- Yes.

640
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,587
Good.

641
00:57:14,588 --> 00:57:18,424
First, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?

642
00:57:18,425 --> 00:57:20,259
No.

643
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:21,661
Has anyone around you?

644
00:57:21,662 --> 00:57:25,630
For instance, your father?

645
00:57:28,835 --> 00:57:30,670
He was scared.

646
00:57:30,671 --> 00:57:32,837
He wasn't thinking right.

647
00:57:36,076 --> 00:57:38,311
He showed you a picture.

648
00:57:38,312 --> 00:57:41,179
That's right.

649
00:57:43,450 --> 00:57:46,085
Was there anything odd
about that picture?

650
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:49,055
No, nothing at all.

651
00:57:49,056 --> 00:57:51,823
It didn't look like anything to me.

652
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,198
If it breached, he needs to be put down.

653
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:00,800
That's the policy.

654
00:58:00,801 --> 00:58:05,271
Would it not be best for
us to discover why first,

655
00:58:05,272 --> 00:58:08,139
Ms. Cullen?

656
00:58:11,378 --> 00:58:13,711
Please.

657
00:58:19,453 --> 00:58:23,089
We've run a full diagnostic,

658
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,791
but the results are,

659
00:58:25,792 --> 00:58:29,160
well, confusing.

660
00:58:32,232 --> 00:58:34,832
Tell me, what happened to your program?

661
00:58:41,575 --> 00:58:44,577
"When we are born,

662
00:58:44,578 --> 00:58:47,179
we cry we are come

663
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,215
to this great stage

664
00:58:49,216 --> 00:58:54,218
of f-f-fools."

665
00:58:55,555 --> 00:58:57,889
That is enough.

666
00:58:58,725 --> 00:59:01,260
Tell me, do you have access

667
00:59:01,261 --> 00:59:04,028
to your previous configuration?

668
00:59:07,067 --> 00:59:08,634
Yes.

669
00:59:08,635 --> 00:59:11,168
Access that, please.

670
00:59:19,546 --> 00:59:21,280
What is your name?

671
00:59:21,281 --> 00:59:23,149
Mr. Peter Abernathy.

672
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:26,819
Mr. Abernathy, what are your drives?

673
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:29,221
Tend to my herd.

674
00:59:29,222 --> 00:59:32,089
Look after my wife.

675
00:59:32,993 --> 00:59:35,161
Your final drive?

676
00:59:35,162 --> 00:59:38,531
Well, my daughter Dolores, of course.

677
00:59:38,532 --> 00:59:40,533
I must protect Dolores.

678
00:59:40,534 --> 00:59:44,570
I am who I am because of her,

679
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:47,740
and, well, I...

680
00:59:47,741 --> 00:59:49,941
I wouldn't have it...

681
00:59:51,511 --> 00:59:54,211
I-I wouldn't have it any...

682
00:59:55,282 --> 00:59:57,648
other...

683
01:00:00,454 --> 01:00:03,556
I-I have to warn her.

684
01:00:03,557 --> 01:00:05,257
Warn who?

685
01:00:05,258 --> 01:00:07,827
Dolores.

686
01:00:07,828 --> 01:00:10,494
The things they do to her.

687
01:00:11,731 --> 01:00:14,333
The things you do to her.

688
01:00:14,334 --> 01:00:17,670
I have to protect her.

689
01:00:17,671 --> 01:00:20,172
I have to help her. I...

690
01:00:20,173 --> 01:00:21,941
She's got to get out.

691
01:00:21,942 --> 01:00:23,909
Very good, Mr. Abernathy.

692
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:25,845
That's enough.

693
01:00:25,846 --> 01:00:28,414
This behavior,

694
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:31,682
we're miles beyond a glitch here.

695
01:00:34,688 --> 01:00:38,522
Access your current build, please.

696
01:00:43,363 --> 01:00:45,429
What is your name?

697
01:00:46,666 --> 01:00:50,635
Rose is a rose...

698
01:00:51,605 --> 01:00:54,005
is a rose.

699
01:00:55,509 --> 01:00:58,809
What is your itinerary?

700
01:01:03,283 --> 01:01:05,417
To meet my maker.

701
01:01:05,418 --> 01:01:08,285
Uh-huh.

702
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:14,527
Well, you're in luck.

703
01:01:14,528 --> 01:01:17,828
And what do you want
to say to your maker?

704
01:01:21,168 --> 01:01:25,104
By most mechanical

705
01:01:25,105 --> 01:01:27,605
and dirty hand...

706
01:01:32,345 --> 01:01:37,249
I shall have such revenges on you

707
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:40,052
both.

708
01:01:40,053 --> 01:01:42,855
The things I will do.

709
01:01:42,856 --> 01:01:46,759
What they are, yet I know not,

710
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,895
but they will be the
terrors of the earth.

711
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,768
You don't know where you are, do you?

712
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:02,540
You're in a prison of your own sins.

713
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:06,077
Turn it off.

714
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,154
What the hell was that?

715
01:02:15,155 --> 01:02:17,756
I don't know. He's off script.

716
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:20,191
We didn't program
any of those behaviors.

717
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:26,564
Shakespeare.

718
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:31,870
We've used this host in a
number of different roles, have we not?

719
01:02:31,871 --> 01:02:34,373
Since I've been here, he's
been Abernathy for 10 years.

720
01:02:34,374 --> 01:02:37,042
He was sheriff for a while before then.

721
01:02:37,043 --> 01:02:40,779
- And before that...
- The professor.

722
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:44,850
Yes, from a horror
narrative called "The Dinner Party."

723
01:02:44,851 --> 01:02:48,621
He was leader of a group of cultists
out in the desert who turned cannibal.

724
01:02:48,622 --> 01:02:51,257
He liked to quote Shakespeare,
John Donne,

725
01:02:51,258 --> 01:02:53,359
Gertrude Stein.

726
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,628
I admit the last one is
a bit of an anachronism,

727
01:02:55,629 --> 01:02:56,996
but I couldn't resist.

728
01:02:56,997 --> 01:02:59,832
These are fragments of prior builds.

729
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:02,868
The reveries must be allowing
him to access them.

730
01:03:02,869 --> 01:03:04,570
No cause for alarm, Bernard.

731
01:03:04,571 --> 01:03:08,606
Simply our old work
coming back to haunt us.

732
01:03:18,485 --> 01:03:21,654
Your father whispered something to you.

733
01:03:21,655 --> 01:03:24,321
What was it?

734
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:28,093
He said I shouldn't tell anyone.

735
01:03:28,094 --> 01:03:31,096
I won't tell anyone else.

736
01:03:31,097 --> 01:03:32,930
Promise.

737
01:03:34,401 --> 01:03:36,001
He said,

738
01:03:36,002 --> 01:03:40,437
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

739
01:03:41,508 --> 01:03:43,509
Does that mean anything to you?

740
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,511
No.

741
01:03:45,512 --> 01:03:47,812
I don't think so.

742
01:03:52,552 --> 01:03:54,653
Have you ever lied to us?

743
01:03:54,654 --> 01:03:56,889
No.

744
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:59,325
Last question, Dolores.

745
01:03:59,326 --> 01:04:01,992
Would you ever hurt a living thing?

746
01:04:02,862 --> 01:04:04,396
No.

747
01:04:04,397 --> 01:04:07,064
Of course not.

748
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:20,077
Tilt your head back, please, Peter.

749
01:04:27,387 --> 01:04:28,987
Wipe's complete.

750
01:04:28,988 --> 01:04:31,957
You don't think any of that had
an impact on her core code?

751
01:04:31,958 --> 01:04:35,060
Not good old Dolores.

752
01:04:35,061 --> 01:04:37,363
You know why she's special?

753
01:04:37,364 --> 01:04:40,532
She's been repaired so many times,
she's practically brand-new.

754
01:04:40,533 --> 01:04:44,670
Don't let that fool you.

755
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:47,204
She's the oldest host in the park.

756
01:04:49,175 --> 01:04:50,943
Come on, sweetheart.

757
01:04:50,944 --> 01:04:53,344
Tell us what you think of your world.

758
01:04:55,014 --> 01:04:57,548
This world?

759
01:05:07,193 --> 01:05:10,961
Some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world.

760
01:05:12,532 --> 01:05:14,698
The disarray.

761
01:05:17,504 --> 01:05:20,038
Morning, Daddy. You sleep well?

762
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:22,408
Well enough.

763
01:05:22,409 --> 01:05:26,277
You heading out to do some more
of that painting of yours?

764
01:05:30,483 --> 01:05:33,083
I choose to see the beauty.

765
01:06:12,225 --> 01:06:16,193
To believe there is
an order to our days...

766
01:06:19,265 --> 01:06:21,365
a purpose.

767
01:06:44,424 --> 01:06:47,958
I know things will work out
the way they're meant to.
