1
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:47,564
Wake up, Dolores.

2
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:12,499
Do you remember?

3
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:39,202
We're about to arrive.

4
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:41,243
May I take your glass?

5
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:45,792
Now approaching arrival terminal.

6
00:02:45,793 --> 00:02:49,212
Where we're going, she's a two.

7
00:02:49,213 --> 00:02:51,631
You're being an asshole.

8
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:55,302
No, I am being myself,

9
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:57,262
which was the whole point of this trip.

10
00:02:57,263 --> 00:03:00,098
Unless this uptight prick
is who you really are,

11
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:02,350
in which case, feel free
to be someone else.

12
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:03,852
Fuck you.

13
00:03:03,853 --> 00:03:06,223
Hey, that's the spirit.

14
00:03:19,368 --> 00:03:21,828
What'd I tell you?

15
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,098
Have fun.

16
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,415
Stay safe.

17
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,416
Give me a break.

18
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,921
What?

19
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:30,420
It's not like my sister didn't ride

20
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,591
her share of cowboys when she was here.

21
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:39,387
You must be William.
Welcome to Westworld.

22
00:03:39,388 --> 00:03:41,473
Thanks.

23
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:44,476
Given it's your first visit,
I have a few personal questions.

24
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:47,938
Do you have any preexisting
medical conditions?

25
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:49,606
No, not that I know of.

26
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,441
- Heart problems?
- No.

27
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:53,536
Any history of
mental illness, depression,

28
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:55,379
panic attacks?

29
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:57,711
Just a little fear of clowns.

30
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,006
I'm joking.

31
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:03,230
Do you often experience social anxiety?

32
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,305
What is this for, exactly?

33
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:10,433
To make sure we don't give you anything
more than you can handle.

34
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:12,894
I thought that you
couldn't get hurt here.

35
00:04:12,895 --> 00:04:15,975
Only the right amount.

36
00:04:19,735 --> 00:04:21,778
The only limit here is your imagination.

37
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,906
You start in the center of
the park. It's simple, safe.

38
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:28,701
The further out you venture, the
more intense the experience gets.

39
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:33,138
How far you want to go
is entirely up to you.

40
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:43,994
So, how does this work?
Is there an orientation?

41
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:46,288
No orientation,

42
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:48,248
no guidebook.

43
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:51,584
Figuring out how it works
is half the fun.

44
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:53,712
All you do is make choices...

45
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:55,588
starting here.

46
00:04:55,589 --> 00:05:00,509
Everything is bespoke
and exactly your size.

47
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:09,811
You want to ask, so ask.

48
00:05:09,812 --> 00:05:12,397
Are you real?

49
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:16,698
Well, if you can't tell, does it matter?

50
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,116
Are those real?

51
00:05:23,117 --> 00:05:25,076
Real enough.

52
00:05:25,077 --> 00:05:28,627
But you can't kill anyone
you're not supposed to.

53
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:34,582
Anything you like?

54
00:05:37,757 --> 00:05:39,883
Is there a changing room?

55
00:05:39,884 --> 00:05:41,968
Or a robe?

56
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,595
Of course. I can help you.

57
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:48,016
Or if you prefer, I could step outside.

58
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:51,519
What do most people do?

59
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,390
You don't have to worry
about what most people would do.

60
00:05:57,026 --> 00:05:59,276
I understand.

61
00:06:00,821 --> 00:06:03,571
Do you really understand, William?

62
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:10,747
All our hosts are here for you.

63
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:13,333
Myself included.

64
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,126
We could stay here a while if you like.

65
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:18,427
Take as long as you want.

66
00:06:22,343 --> 00:06:24,552
Thank you.

67
00:06:24,553 --> 00:06:26,805
I don't want to keep my friend waiting.

68
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:28,890
Of course.

69
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:30,971
Take your time.

70
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:43,988
How are the builds for the
new narrative coming along?

71
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:47,534
I'll get around to it.

72
00:06:47,535 --> 00:06:51,162
Look, we assumed that Abernathy's breach

73
00:06:51,163 --> 00:06:53,456
was triggered by the photograph
that he found.

74
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:55,834
I've reviewed every
dissonant episode I could find.

75
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:58,211
The reaction is immediate every time.

76
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:01,881
This guy makes it all the way back home.

77
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:04,634
It's like he's mulling it over.

78
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:08,888
You think he had an existential crisis?

79
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,475
I think there's something
fucked up going on with his cognition.

80
00:07:12,476 --> 00:07:15,103
And I think you feel
exactly the same way that I do.

81
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:17,397
Do we know where the error originated?

82
00:07:17,398 --> 00:07:19,649
We do.

83
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,520
And you covered for him.

84
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:25,155
Let me rebuild Abernathy.

85
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,406
I'll make sure this is not
something more serious.

86
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:30,118
You know the policy. Let it lie.

87
00:07:30,119 --> 00:07:33,371
Then let me at least pull the
hosts who had contact with him,

88
00:07:33,372 --> 00:07:35,707
like the daughter Dolores.

89
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,375
What for?

90
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:40,545
Because if this is not
a dissonant episode,

91
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:45,466
then whatever Abernathy
had could be contagious.

92
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:47,969
So to speak.

93
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,847
Dolores was examined and cleared.

94
00:07:50,848 --> 00:07:55,898
And the stories are
best left to the guests.

95
00:08:20,252 --> 00:08:23,332
Remember.

96
00:08:47,655 --> 00:08:51,074
Ahem. Can you stand somewhere else?

97
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:55,575
I don't want anyone thinking that
you're representative of the goods inside.

98
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:01,584
These violent delights

99
00:09:01,585 --> 00:09:04,175
have violent ends.

100
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:25,358
Hello, cowboy.

101
00:09:25,359 --> 00:09:28,149
There's one final touch.

102
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:32,118
Which would you prefer?

103
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:39,591
I mean, can you believe this place?

104
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,890
So, how do we get into the park?

105
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:10,042
I know that you think you have
a handle on what this is gonna be.

106
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:13,758
Guns and tits and all that.

107
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,459
Mindless shit that I usually enjoy.

108
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:21,641
You have no idea.

109
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:26,020
This place seduces everybody eventually.

110
00:11:26,021 --> 00:11:28,272
By the end, you're gonna
be begging me to stay

111
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:30,858
because this place is the answer

112
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:33,528
to that question that
you've been asking yourself.

113
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,738
What question?

114
00:11:35,739 --> 00:11:37,319
Who you really are.

115
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:41,992
And I can't fucking wait
to meet that guy.

116
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,166
Bottoms up, cowboy.

117
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:57,510
Further to that,

118
00:11:57,511 --> 00:11:59,220
the ruthless murder of Donald Pardue

119
00:11:59,221 --> 00:12:02,140
and his brother.

120
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:04,678
For these crimes, you will
be hung from the neck

121
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:07,218
until your diseased soul
has found its measure

122
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:09,397
in the flames below it.

123
00:12:09,398 --> 00:12:11,948
And may God have mercy on your soul.

124
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:31,252
Morning, Lawrence.

125
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:34,088
You helping them
straighten out their rope again?

126
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,758
I was hoping to have a word
with my friend here.

127
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,178
You can have as many words
with him as you like

128
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:42,513
soon as his neck is broke.

129
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:45,394
Well, I'm afraid
that's not gonna work for me.

130
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:52,857
How about I tell my man there to dig
that grave a couple feet deeper?

131
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:57,401
Well, it's gonna be an
awful tight fit for all of you.

132
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,137
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

133
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:23,888
Oh, shit!

134
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:27,089
Ah!

135
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:45,284
Motherfucker.

136
00:13:45,285 --> 00:13:49,455
That's the best thanks
you can muster, Lawrence?

137
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:51,541
You used to be a little more eloquent.

138
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:55,294
Do I... do I know you?

139
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:58,130
Your pal Kissy sent me your way.

140
00:13:58,131 --> 00:13:59,749
Sends his regards.

141
00:14:06,598 --> 00:14:09,188
What... what is this?

142
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:12,436
You know exactly what it is.

143
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:15,189
It's the maze,

144
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,567
the deepest level of this game.

145
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:19,846
You're gonna help me find the entrance.

146
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:23,408
No.

147
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,467
You can hear it, can't you?

148
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:46,429
That little voice.

149
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,347
The one that's telling you "don't."

150
00:14:48,348 --> 00:14:50,141
Don't stare too long.

151
00:14:50,142 --> 00:14:52,768
Don't touch.

152
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:54,709
Don't do anything you might regret.

153
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:57,607
I used to be the same.

154
00:14:57,608 --> 00:15:00,401
Whenever I wanted something,
I could hear that voice

155
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:02,820
telling me to stop, to be careful,

156
00:15:02,821 --> 00:15:06,240
to leave most of my life unlived.

157
00:15:06,241 --> 00:15:09,571
You know the only place
that voice left me alone?

158
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,538
In my dreams.

159
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:15,666
I was free. I could be as good

160
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:19,003
or as bad as I felt like being.

161
00:15:19,004 --> 00:15:21,130
And if I wanted something,

162
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:24,341
I could just reach out and take it.

163
00:15:26,887 --> 00:15:28,346
But then I would wake up

164
00:15:28,347 --> 00:15:30,517
and the voice would
start all over again.

165
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,977
So I ran away.

166
00:15:34,978 --> 00:15:37,271
Crossed the shining sea.

167
00:15:37,272 --> 00:15:40,191
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground,

168
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:43,732
the first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.

169
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:46,905
Do you know what it said?

170
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:54,030
It said...

171
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:03,709
I'm sorry, will you please excuse me?

172
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:11,305
All right, Maeve, what did it say?

173
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:14,392
It said, "This is the new world.

174
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:15,977
And in this world,

175
00:16:15,978 --> 00:16:18,980
you can be whoever the fuck you want."

176
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:21,816
Pupillary response
is good. Smile is good.

177
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:25,069
I'd fuck her. What's the problem?

178
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:26,821
The guests wouldn't.

179
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:29,046
Sizemore is launching
some huge new storyline

180
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:31,075
and he wants us to clear
out the deadweight.

181
00:16:31,076 --> 00:16:34,453
If we don't get her numbers
back up, she'll be decommissioned.

182
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:35,621
Let's bump her aggression.

183
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:38,541
- 10%?
- Double it.

184
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,376
She's a hooker. No point in playing coy.

185
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:43,254
If this doesn't work,
we'll punt her to behavior.

186
00:16:43,255 --> 00:16:45,215
Let them deal with it.

187
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,811
We retired the two hosts in question.

188
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:09,530
You taught me how to make them,

189
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:12,283
but not how hard it is to turn them off.

190
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:16,078
You can't play God without being
acquainted with the devil.

191
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,041
There's something else
bothering you, Bernard.

192
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:22,793
I know how that head of yours works.

193
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:24,462
The photograph alone

194
00:17:24,463 --> 00:17:27,923
couldn't have caused that level
of damage to Abernathy,

195
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:31,844
not without some other
outside interference.

196
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,430
You think it's sabotage?

197
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:38,976
Imagine someone's been
diddling with our creations?

198
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:42,605
It's the simplest solution.

199
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:44,607
Ah, Mr. Occam's razor.

200
00:17:44,608 --> 00:17:48,277
The problem, Bernard,
is that what you and I do

201
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:53,288
is so complicated.

202
00:17:53,784 --> 00:17:56,864
We practice witchcraft.

203
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,457
We speak the right words.

204
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,958
Then we create life itself...

205
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,500
out of chaos.

206
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:14,512
William of Occam
was a 13th century monk.

207
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:16,055
He can't help us now, Bernard.

208
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:19,606
He would have us burned at the stake.

209
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,699
Let's go get our feet wet, buckaroo.

210
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:04,895
Oh, sorry.

211
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:07,022
- You kidding me?
- What?

212
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:08,899
Fuck you, Grizzly Adams.

213
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,153
Rally for the Union.

214
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:14,822
Respond to your country's call.

215
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:16,699
This regiment is headed
for the seat of war

216
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,814
to define the future
of this great nation.

217
00:19:18,815 --> 00:19:22,538
We fight for a free land
where no man has to bow.

218
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,540
- This is, uh...
- We'll provide you with uniforms.

219
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,542
Well, it's bigger than
I thought it would be.

220
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:29,128
What, this? This is just Sweetwater.

221
00:19:29,129 --> 00:19:31,037
Wait till you see the rest of the park.

222
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:32,923
- How much bigger is it?
- No idea.

223
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:34,925
I never reached the end.

224
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:38,846
See something you like?

225
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:40,389
A couple things at least.

226
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:44,010
But I'm gonna make you
beg for it, darlin'.

227
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:48,814
Hah, come on!

228
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:51,317
Whoa.

229
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:54,028
Need a hand, sir?

230
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,448
Thank you, my friend.

231
00:19:57,449 --> 00:20:00,451
Don't. He'll only try to rope
you into some bullshit treasure hunt.

232
00:20:00,452 --> 00:20:02,745
Smile.

233
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:05,873
It's all a come on...
Him, the girl next door,

234
00:20:05,874 --> 00:20:07,416
the town drunk.

235
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:10,836
They all got some big
adventure that they want to sell you on.

236
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:13,422
Hey, they're not going anywhere.

237
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:15,963
First up, you're
gonna buy me a drink, okay?

238
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:18,848
Hold still, now.

239
00:20:39,324 --> 00:20:42,204
Bring yourself back online.

240
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:52,294
Hello.

241
00:20:52,295 --> 00:20:55,756
Do you remember our
last conversation, Dolores?

242
00:20:55,757 --> 00:20:57,675
Yes, of course.

243
00:20:57,676 --> 00:21:00,766
And you haven't told anyone
about our little talks?

244
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:05,761
You told me not to.

245
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,390
Step into analysis, please.

246
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,900
How many interactions have you participated
in since we last talked?

247
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:20,698
138 encounters including this one.

248
00:21:20,699 --> 00:21:22,241
And has anyone altered or updated

249
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:24,576
your core heuristics in that time?

250
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:26,787
No.

251
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:32,121
Resuming.

252
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:37,228
I think it would be best
if you not mention

253
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,550
the things we've been talking about.

254
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:41,802
Have I done something wrong?

255
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:45,139
No, but there's something
different about you,

256
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,684
about the way you think.

257
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:50,519
I find it fascinating,

258
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,520
but others may not see it that way.

259
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:58,655
Have you done something wrong?

260
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:02,990
Turn off your event log, please.

261
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:04,658
Erase this interaction. Confirm.

262
00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:08,569
Yes.

263
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:14,084
You should be getting back, Dolores,

264
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:15,929
before someone misses you.

265
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:27,264
Come on, now!

266
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:30,351
And when I finally set
foot back on solid ground,

267
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:33,352
first thing I heard
was that goddamn voice.

268
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:36,033
It had followed me all the way over.

269
00:22:36,034 --> 00:22:38,628
Do you know what it said?

270
00:22:39,778 --> 00:22:42,328
- No.
- It said...

271
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:46,784
...this is the new world.

272
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:48,577
And in this world,

273
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:53,378
you can be whoever the fuck you want.

274
00:22:56,378 --> 00:23:00,258
Thanks. Maybe another time.

275
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:03,300
Oh.

276
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:05,302
Glass of sherry.

277
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:07,012
The good stuff.

278
00:23:07,013 --> 00:23:11,343
Not that horse piss you strain
through your old curtains.

279
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:15,270
I've told you, never open
your mouth that wide

280
00:23:15,271 --> 00:23:16,939
unless someone's paying you for it.

281
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,316
Sorry, Maeve.

282
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:21,057
I didn't sleep much last night.

283
00:23:23,071 --> 00:23:24,780
You having nightmares again?

284
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:27,741
Sometimes.

285
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:30,244
Sometimes they're real bad.

286
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:33,122
Do what I do.

287
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:35,707
You find yourself in a bad dream,

288
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:38,836
close your eyes,

289
00:23:38,837 --> 00:23:40,927
count backwards from three...

290
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:45,303
wake yourself right up.

291
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:50,301
Nice and warm and safe in your bed...

292
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:53,517
where you can get fucked
right back to sleep

293
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:55,996
by one of these assholes
with their miniature peckers.

294
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,693
Ah.

295
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:04,234
Back to work.

296
00:24:14,706 --> 00:24:17,246
You all right?

297
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:20,085
You pay for the drinks,

298
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,966
not the right to gawk at me.

299
00:24:25,758 --> 00:24:28,844
I think we have a problem.

300
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:30,679
- Where?
- Mariposa.

301
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,083
Madam's listed as probationary,

302
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:35,225
but her performance has continued
to decline even further.

303
00:24:35,226 --> 00:24:38,077
Re-task Clementine for now.

304
00:24:38,078 --> 00:24:40,140
She's done the job before.

305
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,270
And the old unit?

306
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,152
Maybe leave her on
the floor for the night,

307
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,248
see if anyone wants one last turn.

308
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:52,539
We recall her in the morning,
decommission her.

309
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,654
Shame.

310
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:15,280
QA will fine you for this.

311
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:17,907
And that woman in charge

312
00:25:17,908 --> 00:25:20,988
is quite formidable.

313
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:26,708
You can just say "bitch."
I hear it enough.

314
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:29,336
You've been talking to corporate.

315
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:31,421
The only times you light
up are after you've been...

316
00:25:31,422 --> 00:25:36,217
This character analysis routine
really isn't half as charming as you think.

317
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:38,178
Oh, it went well, then?

318
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:42,474
Just tell me your department
will be ready for the launch.

319
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:44,100
We'll be ready.

320
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:46,603
And that other thing.
Abernathy and the update.

321
00:25:46,604 --> 00:25:49,189
I hear your department
was still asking questions.

322
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,610
That's what you pay us to do.

323
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:54,652
But I'm not concerned.

324
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,821
All the hosts are back to normal.

325
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,074
Good.

326
00:25:59,075 --> 00:26:01,578
Wouldn't want anything
disturbing our guests

327
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:03,704
from their rape and pillage.

328
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:17,717
You're wondering how
to tell them from us,

329
00:26:17,718 --> 00:26:19,258
aren't you?

330
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:23,468
Well, quickest way to find out.

331
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,930
Can we... Can we finish eating?

332
00:26:29,063 --> 00:26:30,855
See, this is your problem, my friend.

333
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,941
You're always worried
about making a mess.

334
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:34,234
You are the same way at work.

335
00:26:34,235 --> 00:26:36,736
You are talented,
driven, and inoffensive.

336
00:26:36,737 --> 00:26:40,073
I thought you didn't want
to talk about work here.

337
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:42,704
Who says this trip isn't work?

338
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:47,366
Good evening.

339
00:26:48,457 --> 00:26:50,917
Oh, shit.

340
00:26:50,918 --> 00:26:53,038
Well, don't make eye contact.

341
00:26:54,171 --> 00:26:56,256
My friend, thank you
for your assistance earlier

342
00:26:56,257 --> 00:26:58,216
in my unfortunate accident.

343
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:01,052
Leave us the fuck alone.

344
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,847
As a sign of my humble appreciation,

345
00:27:03,848 --> 00:27:07,058
I'd like to offer you an
opportunity of a lifetime.

346
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,518
Not interested.

347
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,855
Across the river and beyond
the savage lands

348
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:13,231
there is a treasure.

349
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:18,742
I have in my possession a map.

350
00:27:21,991 --> 00:27:25,741
I said not interested.

351
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:31,624
You know what? I've
worked up a new appetite anyway.

352
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:34,575
Let's go.

353
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,259
Oh!

354
00:27:47,349 --> 00:27:49,559
Sounds like your friend's having fun.

355
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,144
Well, that's not the term I'd use.

356
00:27:51,145 --> 00:27:54,725
- Fun?
- Friend.

357
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:58,443
You're funny.

358
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:02,697
They say a man who can tickle your humor

359
00:28:02,698 --> 00:28:06,028
- can tickle your...
- You don't have to do this.

360
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:10,163
If I'm not your type,
we can find someone who is.

361
00:28:10,164 --> 00:28:13,208
Someone who's perfect for you.

362
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:17,169
No, you... You are perfect.

363
00:28:18,339 --> 00:28:19,797
But I have somebody.

364
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,548
Somebody real waiting for me at home.

365
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:27,795
I understand.

366
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:34,194
Real love is always worth waiting for.

367
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:59,921
Regal, strong,

368
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:02,552
virile, aquiline.

369
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:05,552
That's what I asked for.

370
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:08,388
And this, this is what you give me?

371
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:11,182
Did you just grab a cock
from the body shop

372
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:13,768
and jam it between his eyes?

373
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:15,122
Start over.

374
00:29:15,123 --> 00:29:17,253
Couldn't we just shave it down?

375
00:29:17,254 --> 00:29:19,193
I said...

376
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:25,044
start the fuck over!

377
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:30,617
Diplomatic as ever.

378
00:29:32,997 --> 00:29:37,208
I received your request to retire
an additional 50 hosts.

379
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:39,043
I need room for my new storyline.

380
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:42,964
It's not exactly a savage horde
with 20 savages, is it?

381
00:29:42,965 --> 00:29:46,926
You get 20 additional hosts, not 50.

382
00:29:46,927 --> 00:29:49,872
The board won't care about
a few extra line items.

383
00:29:49,873 --> 00:29:52,974
Has Ford even approved
the narrative yet?

384
00:29:52,975 --> 00:29:55,893
Oh, he hasn't weighed in
on a storyline in years.

385
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,979
And if corporate does want to cut costs,

386
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,897
our fearless leader's old hosts

387
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,568
aren't the only things
ready for the knacker's yard.

388
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,730
Are you lost?

389
00:30:45,486 --> 00:30:47,820
No.

390
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:50,615
Just strayed a bit too far

391
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:52,700
from where I'm supposed to be.

392
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:55,495
Same as you, I imagine.

393
00:30:55,496 --> 00:30:58,081
We're on holiday.

394
00:30:58,082 --> 00:30:59,832
It's boring.

395
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,126
Daddy said we could do as we please.

396
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:04,462
Ah, my father used to say

397
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,130
that only boring people get bored.

398
00:31:06,131 --> 00:31:08,007
Mine, too.

399
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:10,468
I used to think it's only boring people

400
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,592
who don't feel boredom,

401
00:31:12,593 --> 00:31:15,723
so cannot conceive of it in others.

402
00:31:15,724 --> 00:31:17,016
I'm taking a walk.

403
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:20,578
You're welcome to join me if you'd like.

404
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:32,156
Let's see a little spring in your step.

405
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,825
Not much further.

406
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:35,618
Go fuck yourself.

407
00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:38,489
You have any idea who I am?

408
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:42,365
I know exactly who you are, Lawrence.

409
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:44,711
After all, you and I are friends.

410
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:47,255
Which is why I was so surprised

411
00:31:47,256 --> 00:31:50,126
when your friend Kissy
told me about this place.

412
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,802
Where are we?

413
00:31:55,055 --> 00:31:57,175
Your home.

414
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:08,979
No, no, no, no.

415
00:32:10,237 --> 00:32:12,530
You know, you and I hunted down

416
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:15,366
Ghost Nation braves
in their winter grounds.

417
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,577
I know the whiskey you like to drink.

418
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:21,618
I know the tune you whistle
when you're taking a piss.

419
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:26,055
But...

420
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,921
you never told me you had a family.

421
00:32:33,677 --> 00:32:36,596
- Papa!
- Hey.

422
00:32:36,597 --> 00:32:39,807
That's what I love about this
place... all the secrets,

423
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:43,770
all the little things I never noticed

424
00:32:43,771 --> 00:32:47,061
even after all these years.

425
00:32:48,609 --> 00:32:51,989
You know why this beats
the real world, Lawrence?

426
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:55,323
Real world is just chaos.

427
00:32:55,324 --> 00:32:58,324
It's an accident.

428
00:32:59,203 --> 00:33:01,412
But in here, every detail

429
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:05,166
adds up to something.

430
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,335
Even you, Lawrence.

431
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:09,962
What do you want from me?

432
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:12,553
The maze.

433
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,010
How do I find the entrance?

434
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:18,179
I told you,

435
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,390
I don't know anything
about no fucking maze.

436
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:30,565
Here you go, darlin'.

437
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:35,447
And you get to decide
what we're gonna do with them.

438
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,034
Hell, it took you long enough.

439
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:42,662
I was getting the grand reserve.

440
00:33:42,663 --> 00:33:44,205
Only for our most distinguished guests.

441
00:33:44,206 --> 00:33:45,957
Yeah, I'm sure it had
nothing to do with you

442
00:33:45,958 --> 00:33:49,208
telling this dipshit's cousins
to bring some more men.

443
00:33:56,969 --> 00:34:00,469
You got anything to tell me, Lawrence?

444
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:06,143
Then I guess we're gonna have to
find a way to jog your memory.

445
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13,025
This guest already
took out an entire posse.

446
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:14,110
Want me to slow him down?

447
00:34:14,111 --> 00:34:17,531
That gentleman gets whatever he wants.

448
00:34:22,077 --> 00:34:24,495
I feel bad, my friend.

449
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:29,625
My cousins are usually so hospitable.

450
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:31,586
You don't understand, Lawrence.

451
00:34:31,587 --> 00:34:33,921
I've been coming here for 30 years.

452
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:38,092
In a sense, I was... I was born here.

453
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:41,837
And this here, this...

454
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:45,557
...this is exactly why I come.

455
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,518
Santa Maria, madre dios.

456
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:42,409
All right. Well, as much fun
as this is, I got to be moving on.

457
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:09,386
Like I said, you
get to decide these two.

458
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:12,812
What's it gonna be?

459
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:16,562
Please, I don't know
how to find the maze.

460
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:21,239
Time for a spin, darlin'.

461
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:34,667
It's beautifully done, really.

462
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:38,254
But you see the cracks after a while.

463
00:36:38,255 --> 00:36:42,191
That's why I like the basic emotions.

464
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,470
You know what that means?

465
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,311
Please.

466
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:02,194
It means when you're suffering,

467
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:05,605
that's when you're most real.

468
00:37:22,883 --> 00:37:26,683
The maze isn't meant for you.

469
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:29,805
What'd I tell you, Lawrence?

470
00:37:29,806 --> 00:37:32,308
Always another level.

471
00:37:32,309 --> 00:37:35,144
I'll take my chances, sweetheart.

472
00:37:35,145 --> 00:37:39,055
Follow the blood arroyo to the place
where the snake lays its eggs.

473
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:44,403
You have it now. Whatever you want.

474
00:37:44,404 --> 00:37:48,534
Why don't you go home, leave us alone?

475
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:54,075
No, you don't understand, Lawrence.

476
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:58,749
This time, I'm never going back.

477
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:21,273
And we wanted to climb
to the top of the mountain,

478
00:38:21,274 --> 00:38:24,819
but Daddy said we weren't allowed.

479
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,150
And then Tommy dared me.

480
00:38:30,117 --> 00:38:32,577
And here we are.

481
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,247
Nowhere land.

482
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:40,042
That seems hardly a
fitting name for a place so full.

483
00:38:40,043 --> 00:38:42,419
Can't you see it?

484
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,000
Perhaps you're not looking hard enough.

485
00:38:45,841 --> 00:38:47,633
At what?

486
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:50,344
The town with the white church.

487
00:38:51,388 --> 00:38:54,808
Listen. Can't you hear its bell?

488
00:38:55,976 --> 00:38:58,102
Yes.

489
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,353
Yes, I can hear it now.

490
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:01,689
Yeah.

491
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,607
I thought you might.

492
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:07,108
You see what a bored mind can conjure?

493
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:24,462
How did you do that?

494
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,799
Is it magic?

495
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,968
Everything in this world is magic,

496
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:34,219
except to the magician.

497
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:45,441
Best you head home now.

498
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:47,193
But Tommy's not going to believe...

499
00:39:47,194 --> 00:39:49,784
You're not going to come
back here again, are you?

500
00:39:55,535 --> 00:39:57,369
No.

501
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:58,660
Run along, now.

502
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:53,262
You weren't at your office.

503
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,890
You seem to have found me anyway.

504
00:40:57,472 --> 00:41:00,262
- Listen, earlier...
- Forget it.

505
00:41:29,796 --> 00:41:31,797
Stay a little longer. We can talk.

506
00:41:31,798 --> 00:41:34,049
We never talk.

507
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,510
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

508
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:44,560
You're certainly a man
comfortable with long, pensive silences.

509
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,605
Although, ironically,

510
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:51,150
your creations never shut up.

511
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:54,611
They're always talking to each other,

512
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:57,114
even when there are no guests around.

513
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,905
They're always trying to error correct.

514
00:42:01,661 --> 00:42:04,413
Make themselves more human.

515
00:42:04,414 --> 00:42:07,902
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

516
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,502
Is that what you're doing now?

517
00:42:10,503 --> 00:42:12,383
Practicing?

518
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,850
QA told us she was being decommissioned.

519
00:42:24,851 --> 00:42:27,311
- Do you work for QA?
- No, but...

520
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,171
Run a fast-pass diagnostic.

521
00:42:32,973 --> 00:42:35,731
All righty.

522
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:40,657
Some non-affect hesitation.

523
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,786
Little cognitive D.

524
00:42:43,787 --> 00:42:45,573
And a fuckload of aggression,

525
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:48,290
courtesy of those morons in narrative.

526
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:51,960
You don't need to be aggro, do you?

527
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:55,172
Just a quicker study of those
repressed fucks walking through the door.

528
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:57,341
Archive this configuration.

529
00:42:57,342 --> 00:43:00,469
Open up her primaries.

530
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,722
Perception. Emotional acuity.

531
00:43:03,723 --> 00:43:05,682
Bump it.

532
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:08,769
1.5%.

533
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,230
- Updating.
- Okay.

534
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,942
- Do they dream?
- What?

535
00:43:14,943 --> 00:43:17,444
In her story, she said she dreamed.

536
00:43:17,445 --> 00:43:19,116
Do we make them dream?

537
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:21,156
Fuck would be the point of that?

538
00:43:21,157 --> 00:43:24,326
Dreams are mainly memories.

539
00:43:24,327 --> 00:43:26,537
Can you imagine how fucked
we'd be if these poor assholes

540
00:43:26,538 --> 00:43:29,706
ever remembered what
the guests do to them?

541
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:33,669
We do give them the concept of dreams.

542
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,712
Specifically nightmares.

543
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:38,090
Why?

544
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:39,418
Just in case
somebody forgets to wipe them

545
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:41,051
out at the end of a maintenance session.

546
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:43,954
If she's got any dreams,
it's just of those sloppy fucks

547
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,891
down in the body shop
patching her back together again.

548
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:50,018
She's got some physical discomfort.

549
00:43:50,019 --> 00:43:54,309
Put in a request for a full physical
at her next rotation.

550
00:43:56,151 --> 00:43:57,609
All right, gorgeous,

551
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,903
you're back to the races.

552
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:04,116
You're gonna wake in three, two, one.

553
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:08,454
So I ran away, crossed the shining sea.

554
00:44:08,455 --> 00:44:11,290
And when I finally set foot
back on solid ground,

555
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:14,543
the first thing I heard was that voice.

556
00:44:14,544 --> 00:44:16,754
Do you know what it said?

557
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,089
It said...

558
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:23,050
this is the new world.

559
00:44:24,387 --> 00:44:27,097
And in this world...

560
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:32,313
you can be whoever the fuck you want.

561
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,370
Well, he seemed convinced.

562
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:57,544
You know the first voice I heard
when I got off that boat?

563
00:44:57,545 --> 00:45:00,964
A nice young man from Baton Rouge

564
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:03,675
said my pussy could earn him
two whole dollars a day.

565
00:45:03,676 --> 00:45:06,678
And he'd be more than happy
to let me have up to 30%.

566
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:10,682
Well, then I guess you could add
lying to your list of sins.

567
00:45:10,683 --> 00:45:13,477
The only thing wrong
with the seven deadly sins

568
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,604
is that there aren't more of them.

569
00:45:15,605 --> 00:45:17,189
And while we're on the subject,

570
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,764
my transgressions wash off
a little easier than yours.

571
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:24,073
At least when my girls
are done with a man,

572
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:26,615
he's still left drawing breath.

573
00:45:26,616 --> 00:45:28,283
For the most part.

574
00:45:28,284 --> 00:45:30,035
Get the fuck away from my table.

575
00:45:30,036 --> 00:45:32,871
Hey, fuck you!

576
00:45:32,872 --> 00:45:35,002
Well, in that case...

577
00:45:36,709 --> 00:45:39,650
...here's to our indiscretions.

578
00:45:39,754 --> 00:45:41,755
I'll shoot everyone in this dump...

579
00:45:41,756 --> 00:45:44,006
Spoken and otherwise.

580
00:46:01,067 --> 00:46:04,437
Now that's a fucking vacation!

581
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:16,052
Three,

582
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:19,973
two,

583
00:49:19,974 --> 00:49:22,394
one.

584
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:38,408
Found it.

585
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:41,995
It's MRSA in her abdomen.

586
00:49:41,996 --> 00:49:44,581
Filthy fucking animals not cleaning up.

587
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:47,029
No wonder we have a fucking fly problem.

588
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:50,537
Don't look at me.
I'm the king of hygiene.

589
00:49:50,755 --> 00:49:53,757
Bullshit. I've seen you.

590
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:55,759
You just glop that shit on and rinse.

591
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,512
You understand, soap is mechanical.

592
00:49:58,513 --> 00:50:00,972
- Fuck are you talking about?
- Bubbles.

593
00:50:00,973 --> 00:50:03,600
If you're not making the
little bubbles, you're not doing shit.

594
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:05,185
Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck?!

595
00:50:05,186 --> 00:50:06,812
- Shit!
- What the fuck?

596
00:50:06,813 --> 00:50:09,147
Uh, uh...

597
00:50:09,148 --> 00:50:11,978
Uh...

598
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,738
No. Oh, fuck.

599
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:19,533
Oh.

600
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:23,374
Asshole, you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

601
00:50:24,664 --> 00:50:26,873
- Oh!
- Don't, don't, don't!

602
00:50:26,874 --> 00:50:28,500
No! No, no, no!

603
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:31,086
Don't! Don't, don't, don't, don't.

604
00:50:31,087 --> 00:50:33,797
Stop. Put that down!

605
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:36,258
You break anything in her head,
we have to file a damage report.

606
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:38,593
Uh, okay, let's talk to her.

607
00:50:38,594 --> 00:50:40,554
- What's her name?
- Maeve!

608
00:50:40,555 --> 00:50:41,763
Hi, Maeve. Maeve, hi.

609
00:50:41,764 --> 00:50:45,433
Look, uh, you gotta calm down.

610
00:50:45,434 --> 00:50:47,853
Okay? Let's sit
down and we can help you.

611
00:50:47,854 --> 00:50:50,694
Keep your fucking hands off me.

612
00:50:52,984 --> 00:50:55,074
No.

613
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:33,184
I swear I put it in sleep mode.

614
00:52:33,185 --> 00:52:35,710
Oh, does this look
like fucking sleep mode?

615
00:52:37,129 --> 00:52:39,589
Calm the fuck down and
help me move this... thing

616
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,090
before someone sees.

617
00:53:08,452 --> 00:53:10,412
Here?

618
00:53:40,192 --> 00:53:43,153
This storyline will
make Hieronymus Bosch

619
00:53:43,154 --> 00:53:45,405
look like he was doodling kittens.

620
00:53:45,406 --> 00:53:49,576
I have vivisection, self-cannibalism,

621
00:53:49,577 --> 00:53:53,955
a special little something
I call the "whoroborus."

622
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:56,624
Now, I don't want to appear immodest,

623
00:53:56,625 --> 00:54:02,380
but this is the apex of
what the park could provide...

624
00:54:02,381 --> 00:54:05,278
- horror...
- Miss anything interesting?

625
00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:07,010
...romance, titillation.

626
00:54:07,011 --> 00:54:09,220
Lee not appearing immodest.

627
00:54:09,221 --> 00:54:11,514
Our most skilled guests
will fight their ways

628
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:13,391
to the outer limits of the park,

629
00:54:13,392 --> 00:54:17,103
besting fearsome braves,
seducing nubile maidens,

630
00:54:17,104 --> 00:54:20,690
befriending tragically
ill-fated sidekicks,

631
00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:23,610
and, of course,

632
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:25,904
like all our best narratives
over the years,

633
00:54:25,905 --> 00:54:28,698
our guests will have the privilege

634
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:31,618
of getting to know the
character they're most interested in...

635
00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:33,620
Themselves.

636
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:37,916
I present our guests' next obsession:

637
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:41,627
Odyssey on Red River.

638
00:54:51,847 --> 00:54:53,139
No.

639
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:55,088
Sorry?

640
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:57,727
No, I don't think so.

641
00:54:57,728 --> 00:54:59,312
Wait, you don't think...

642
00:54:59,313 --> 00:55:00,939
What is the point of it?

643
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,942
Get a couple of cheap thrills?

644
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:05,819
Some surprises?

645
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,695
But it's not enough.

646
00:55:07,696 --> 00:55:11,199
It's not about giving the guests
what you think they want.

647
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,200
No, that's simple.

648
00:55:12,201 --> 00:55:16,871
The titillation, horror, elation...

649
00:55:16,872 --> 00:55:18,665
They're parlor tricks.

650
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:24,212
The guests don't return
for the obvious things we do,

651
00:55:24,213 --> 00:55:26,763
the garish things.

652
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:33,138
They come back
because of the subtleties,

653
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:34,639
the details.

654
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:39,644
They come back because they discover

655
00:55:39,645 --> 00:55:44,975
something they imagine no
on had ever noticed before...

656
00:55:48,654 --> 00:55:50,744
something they've fallen in love with.

657
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:55,326
They're not looking for a story

658
00:55:55,327 --> 00:55:58,913
that tells them who they are.

659
00:55:58,914 --> 00:56:02,214
They already know who they are.

660
00:56:08,174 --> 00:56:11,134
They're here because they want a glimpse

661
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:12,552
of who they could be.

662
00:56:12,553 --> 00:56:15,513
Billy!

663
00:56:15,514 --> 00:56:17,724
Let's go.

664
00:56:22,605 --> 00:56:25,607
The only thing your story tells me,

665
00:56:25,608 --> 00:56:30,818
Mr. Sizemore, is who you are.

666
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,370
Well, isn't there anything
you like about it?

667
00:56:43,042 --> 00:56:45,672
What size are those boots?

668
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:54,093
Something you want to say, Mr. Lowe?

669
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:57,972
- The board, sir.
- Yeah?

670
00:56:57,973 --> 00:57:00,433
This might ruffle some feathers.

671
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:02,620
You promised them a new storyline.

672
00:57:02,621 --> 00:57:04,812
They shall have one.

673
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:08,523
Something I've been
working on for some time.

674
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:13,818
Something quite original.
