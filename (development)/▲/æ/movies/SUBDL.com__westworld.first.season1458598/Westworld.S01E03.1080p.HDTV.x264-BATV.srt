1
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,872
Good morning, Dolores.

2
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:57,740
Bring yourself back online.

3
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:01,712
Hello.

4
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:03,214
Has anyone else interacted with you

5
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:05,917
in a diagnostic since
our last conversation?

6
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,218
No.

7
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,337
I have been cleaned and
serviced three times.

8
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:10,889
No diagnostics.

9
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:14,509
And you haven't told anyone
of our conversations?

10
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,760
You told me not to.

11
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,062
Good.

12
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,570
I brought you a gift.

13
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:31,359
I used to read...

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,028
this story to my son at night.

15
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,696
I thought you might enjoy it.

16
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,371
Try...

17
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:46,790
Try...

18
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,795
this passage.

19
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:57,102
"Dear, dear,

20
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:59,220
how queer everything is today.

21
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:02,974
And yesterday, things went
on just as usual.

22
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,725
I wonder if I've been
changed in the night."

23
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,899
Does that passage make
you think of anything?

24
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,316
It's like the other books we've read.

25
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,121
How so?

26
00:03:16,122 --> 00:03:19,457
It's about change.

27
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,959
Seems to be a common theme.

28
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,495
I guess people like to read

29
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:26,247
about the things that they want the most

30
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,582
and experience the least.

31
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,837
Your son...

32
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:37,140
where is he now?

33
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,229
Nowhere that you would understand, Dolores.

34
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,764
Perhaps that's why I enjoy
our conversations so much.

35
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,937
Analysis.

36
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,322
Why did you ask me about my son?

37
00:03:51,323 --> 00:03:52,941
We've been talking for some duration

38
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,443
and I haven't asked you
a personal question.

39
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,828
Personal questions are
an ingratiating scheme.

40
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:01,082
I see.

41
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,616
Continue, Dolores.

42
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:11,676
"Was I the same when I
got up this morning?

43
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:15,296
I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.

44
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:19,349
But if I'm not the same,
the next question is...

45
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,687
who in the world am I?"

46
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,158
Do you remember?

47
00:05:17,159 --> 00:05:19,909
No! No! No!

48
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:29,003
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores?

49
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:31,871
Start at the beginning.

50
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,297
Ready?

51
00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:14,414
Thank you so much.

52
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,083
Morning, cowboy.

53
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:29,596
Move it! Let's go. Get up there!

54
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,515
Come on! Stand right here.

55
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,154
Shit.

56
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:38,406
You really ought to talk to someone

57
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:39,941
about your poster, Horace.

58
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,692
That likeness is a crime in itself.

59
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:47,665
I'm gonna tend to my nag.

60
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,867
You deal with him.

61
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,120
Ready my pay.

62
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,504
No, no. Get up there.

63
00:07:36,632 --> 00:07:38,166
Don't no man shoot,

64
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,218
or I'll send her to unction.

65
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:42,420
Any of you don't believe it

66
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,421
are welcome to read my biography there.

67
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:49,008
Come on! Let's go.

68
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:58,401
No!

69
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:10,029
Oh, I bet you're juicy
as a freshwater clam.

70
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:31,384
You okay?

71
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,557
Nice shot, amigo.

72
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,395
You got grit.

73
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:46,317
Hey, I'm riding out tonight.

74
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,786
Looking for desperados.

75
00:08:48,787 --> 00:08:51,237
Could cut you in if you're amenable.

76
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:54,792
Someone get the minister down here

77
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:56,909
for what's left of the deputy.

78
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,047
Sure I can't tempt you inside?

79
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:03,416
Just to express my gratitude.

80
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,274
Holy shit.

81
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,161
You popped your cherry.

82
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:38,252
I thought you said we couldn't get shot.

83
00:09:38,253 --> 00:09:40,788
Yeah, well, we can't get killed.

84
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,291
Wouldn't be much of a game
if they can't shoot back.

85
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:46,010
But how do you feel, hmm? Alive?

86
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,296
A little tight in the pants?

87
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,714
She was terrified.

88
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,182
That's why they exist, man,

89
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:54,519
is so you get to feel this.

90
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,804
Come on. Let's go put some
memories in that spank bank.

91
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:58,189
Trust me, you will thank me

92
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,608
after you've been married
to my sister for a year.

93
00:10:00,609 --> 00:10:04,028
Actually, I have something
different in mind.

94
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:05,812
What?

95
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,783
That?

96
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,318
Well, you've been preaching nonstop

97
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,320
about all the narratives in the park,

98
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,988
but all you've done since we've arrived

99
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,157
is fuck and drink, so...

100
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,159
I'm waiting for the good stuff.

101
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,995
This bounty is...

102
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:22,213
JV shit.

103
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:23,748
Then stay here.

104
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,882
I want a little adventure.

105
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,348
I've been looking for you.

106
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,937
I got a late start this morning.

107
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:47,655
Didn't get much sleep last night.

108
00:10:47,656 --> 00:10:49,357
Forgive me if I'm not sympathetic

109
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,692
to the fluctuations of your
sleep cycle, Mr. Lowe.

110
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,245
Ford taking over the narrative
launch at the 11th hour

111
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:57,832
has made the board... uneasy.

112
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,533
Just the board, huh?

113
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,285
I specifically asked you

114
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,588
about whether Ford was
going to be a problem,

115
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:05,673
and you assured me he wasn't.

116
00:11:05,674 --> 00:11:07,758
Well, I can't tell you what I don't know.

117
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:08,960
Well, here's what I know.

118
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,212
As of this morning, Ford's carved out

119
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,713
a huge swath of the park

120
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,348
for whatever storyline he's cooking up

121
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:16,968
and thrown half of
the existing storylines

122
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,936
into disarray.

123
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:20,771
Is there anything I can do?

124
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:22,390
You tell me.

125
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,308
I asked you point-blank

126
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,277
if the problem with the
update was resolved.

127
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:27,228
It is.

128
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,396
Then why are your people

129
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:30,480
still pulling hosts for follow-up?

130
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,035
Get your house in order, Bernard.

131
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:36,237
And if there is a problem,

132
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:38,571
I strongly suggest you tell me.

133
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:45,162
Drop a new bookmark and resume history.

134
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:50,084
Walter's intent on relieving the
milkmaid of her unmentionables.

135
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,919
Switch to analysis.

136
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,504
You didn't report the incident?

137
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,973
Unit self-corrected within
the acceptable window.

138
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:57,591
Right.

139
00:11:57,592 --> 00:12:00,344
Then he self-corrected a fucking
milk bottle into your skull.

140
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,480
It's amazing how resilient the hosts are.

141
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:05,266
You were supposed to have purged
his memory on the last cycle.

142
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,684
I will, but Rebus here

143
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,602
was the last host to interact with Walter.

144
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,188
- Look at this.
- Any for you?

145
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,573
Who said that?

146
00:12:12,574 --> 00:12:14,775
Who's saying that?

147
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,443
Don't you talk to me that way.

148
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,165
I can't hear you.

149
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,250
- Do you see that?
- Hell, yeah, they deserved it.

150
00:12:23,251 --> 00:12:25,503
- He's talking to someone.
- Lousy sons of bitches.

151
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:28,456
He carries on practically
an entire conversation.

152
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:30,790
I need more milk, Arnold.

153
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,342
Who's Arnold?

154
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,047
They're designed to play
off aberrant behavior.

155
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,599
That could explain the conversations.

156
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,967
Fine. Then explain this.

157
00:12:41,853 --> 00:12:45,021
- He kills six hosts.
- I'm gonna get you this time.

158
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,641
He lets the other three go.

159
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,696
I pulled the narrative logs.

160
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:53,481
All six of these hosts

161
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,366
were part of storylines over the years

162
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,651
in which they killed Walter.

163
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,703
It's like he was holding a grudge.

164
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,552
It's a stray.

165
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:16,170
QA needs a tag team to go track it.

166
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,339
Go. Handle the stray.

167
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,891
Do something that's actually
in your job description.

168
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:22,226
The last thing we need

169
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:24,178
is Theresa storming down
here and seeing this.

170
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,147
I'll do a little more digging.

171
00:13:26,148 --> 00:13:28,848
And get our friend here back upstairs.

172
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,580
Lost another one, huh?

173
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,253
Tell me, is QA surveillance coverage

174
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:53,007
really this spotty,
or you just like the nature walks?

175
00:13:53,008 --> 00:13:54,757
Maybe it's the company.

176
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,930
You know, if you wanted
to play cowboy,

177
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:01,549
you could've just used
your employee discount.

178
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,851
The only
thing stopping the hosts

179
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:08,055
from hacking us to pieces
is one line of your code.

180
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,391
No offense, but I sleep with this.

181
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,725
I bet you do.

182
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:25,905
Morning, Samuel.

183
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:37,001
You and your dickless associate

184
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,587
proposing to engage me in a gun battle?

185
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,555
Well, I'd challenge you to a fistfight,

186
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,424
but the way I heard it,

187
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,925
you only like to tussle
with working women.

188
00:14:52,651 --> 00:14:54,433
Get down!

189
00:14:59,407 --> 00:15:01,857
Is he dead?

190
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,111
Dead enough.

191
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,032
Why are we going to handcuff a dead man?

192
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:10,501
Don't want someone walking off with him.

193
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,503
That's not a man anymore.
That's merchandise.

194
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:13,919
$500 worth.

195
00:15:23,682 --> 00:15:25,850
All right, which of you derelicts

196
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:28,302
hitched a dead body outside my saloon?

197
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,387
My apologies, ma'am.

198
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,139
I figured it was preferable
to bringing him inside.

199
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,645
Here.

200
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,395
For your troubles.

201
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,576
Oh, you're new.

202
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,545
Not much of a rind on you.

203
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,383
I'll give you a discount.

204
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,421
Do you mind waiting on that drink a bit?

205
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,536
Don't mind me.

206
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:38,287
Just trying to look chivalrous.

207
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,375
You came back.

208
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,093
I told you I would.

209
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,554
You gonna tell me where you been?

210
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,893
Just... away.

211
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,732
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

212
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,287
What if I don't want to stay here?

213
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:15,743
It's just sometimes I feel like

214
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,495
the world out there is calling me...

215
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,330
whispering, "There's something more."

216
00:17:23,385 --> 00:17:24,718
You've travelled all over these parts.

217
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:27,586
Isn't there anywhere we could go?

218
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:32,977
Well, there is a place

219
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:36,013
I heard about down south...

220
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,097
where the mountains meet the sea.

221
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,401
They say the water's so pure there,

222
00:17:40,402 --> 00:17:43,102
it'll wash the past clean off you.

223
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,822
And you can start again.

224
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,110
I'd like to go there with you.

225
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:59,168
Well, someday, I'll take you.

226
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,623
Someday.

227
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,626
Something wrong?

228
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:11,382
You said someday.

229
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,551
Not today or tomorrow or next week.

230
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,635
Just someday.

231
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,857
"Someday" sounds a lot like
the thing people say

232
00:18:19,858 --> 00:18:22,391
when they actually mean "never."

233
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:31,150
Let's not go someday, Teddy.

234
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,653
Let's go now.

235
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,680
Before I met you, Dolores,
I was a different man.

236
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,014
And I got some reckoning to do

237
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,901
before I can deserve a woman like you.

238
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:05,436
But I'm close.

239
00:19:05,437 --> 00:19:08,355
I'm close to making things right.

240
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,657
And someday soon,

241
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:13,859
we will have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

242
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,163
Now, I best get you home

243
00:19:16,164 --> 00:19:19,031
before your dad starts
loading that shotgun.

244
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:45,441
Father wouldn't let them
roam this close to dark.

245
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,479
Stay put, Dolores.

246
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,771
"The coward dies
a thousand deaths.

247
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:35,659
The valiant taste of death but once."

248
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,997
Of course, Shakespeare never
met a man quite like you, Teddy.

249
00:20:39,998 --> 00:20:44,168
You've died at least a thousand times.

250
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:47,421
And yet, it doesn't dull your courage.

251
00:20:47,422 --> 00:20:51,091
Tell me, is that all you
aspire to, Teddy?

252
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:55,044
There's a girl... Dolores.

253
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,549
Better than I deserve.

254
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,219
But maybe someday soon

255
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,972
we'll have the life we've
both been dreaming of.

256
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:09,109
No, you never will.

257
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,111
Your job is not to protect Dolores,

258
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:12,779
it's to keep her here,

259
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,781
to ensure that the guests find her

260
00:21:14,782 --> 00:21:18,318
if they want to best the
stalwart gunslinger

261
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,869
and have their way with this girl.

262
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:26,743
Tell me, has it never occurred
to you to run off with her?

263
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,546
I got some reckoning to do
before I can be with her.

264
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:33,166
Ah, yes, your mysterious backstory.

265
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,303
It's the reason for my visit.

266
00:21:36,304 --> 00:21:39,840
Do you know why it is a mystery, Teddy?

267
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,142
Because we never actually
bothered to give you one,

268
00:21:42,143 --> 00:21:45,846
just a formless guilt
you will never atone for.

269
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:50,601
But perhaps it is time you
had a worthy story of origin.

270
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:52,269
Would you like that, Teddy?

271
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,522
A small part of my new narrative?

272
00:21:55,523 --> 00:22:00,859
A fiction which, like all great
stories, is rooted in truth?

273
00:22:04,582 --> 00:22:08,168
It starts in a time of war...

274
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:11,288
a world in flames...

275
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:15,707
with a villain called Wyatt.

276
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,712
Wyatt.

277
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,295
Who's Wyatt?

278
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:25,384
Do you remember now, Teddy?

279
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:32,724
Yeah, of course I remember Wyatt.

280
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,647
You look upon the face of true evil,

281
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:39,148
you ain't liable to forget.

282
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:42,401
He claimed he could
hear the voice of God.

283
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,991
It started down near Escalante.

284
00:22:47,992 --> 00:22:50,494
Army was sent to put down the natives.

285
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,079
Bad business.

286
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,749
Wyatt was a sergeant, went missing
while out on some maneuvers

287
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,303
and came back a few weeks later

288
00:22:59,304 --> 00:23:02,504
with some pretty strange ideas.

289
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,742
I wasn't lying, was I?

290
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:23,443
Pretty as a picture

291
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:27,613
and tight as a tympani drum, I reckon.

292
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:35,672
Afternoon.

293
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:38,624
My friend here is new to town.

294
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,510
Figured the rancher's daughter

295
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:43,797
would be a nice way to kick things off.

296
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:47,299
Maybe take us all for a little hayride.

297
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,971
I'm sorry. I have to get home.

298
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,723
My father will be expecting me.

299
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,274
We won't be long.

300
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:56,859
The lady doesn't
appear interested.

301
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:04,484
Try it.

302
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,703
You might get the draw
on me, you might not,

303
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:09,204
but I'd say your odds ain't looking good.

304
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:13,041
Told you I wanted something easy.

305
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:19,416
She ain't worth the lead.

306
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,301
Let's head to Virgil's.

307
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:23,552
See if they'll stake us.

308
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,927
First, you gotta learn how to stand.

309
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,142
Now, take a breath.

310
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,811
Hold it.

311
00:25:29,871 --> 00:25:31,903
Now squeeze.

312
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:45,250
I can't.

313
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,976
Some hands weren't meant to pull a trigger.

314
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:55,310
Perhaps it's for the best.

315
00:26:02,403 --> 00:26:04,486
Come on, now!

316
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:09,159
Teddy, we got another bounty.

317
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,944
I think this is a big one.

318
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:13,196
Man in question gunned
down an entire settlement

319
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,081
out near Flat Rock...

320
00:26:15,082 --> 00:26:17,083
men, women, and children.

321
00:26:17,084 --> 00:26:18,502
I think this may be the man

322
00:26:18,503 --> 00:26:20,620
you've been looking for
quite some time.

323
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:22,956
A man named Wyatt.

324
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,340
Wyatt?

325
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,796
Who is he, Teddy?

326
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,465
You'd be better asking
"what" than "who," ma'am.

327
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:35,302
Wyatt's a pestilence.

328
00:26:35,303 --> 00:26:37,854
Word is, Flood here's the only man ever

329
00:26:37,855 --> 00:26:40,889
come up against him and
live to tell the tale.

330
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:44,893
Give me a moment, Sheriff.

331
00:26:47,532 --> 00:26:49,898
You have to leave again, don't you?

332
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:55,203
You know if I could stay right
here with you, I would.

333
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,327
Promise me you'll come back.

334
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,499
I promise.

335
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,517
I'm gonna come back for you...

336
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:26,184
someday soon.

337
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:46,339
I got a pit in my stomach
the size of a sow's tit.

338
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,174
Cook up that rabbit.

339
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:49,542
Get the wood.

340
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,511
I can't cook shit without a fire.

341
00:27:51,512 --> 00:27:53,546
Aw, don't sell yourself short, Cookie.

342
00:27:53,547 --> 00:27:55,215
You can cook shit in all conditions.

343
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:58,018
Now, see, I pitched them tents.

344
00:27:58,019 --> 00:28:00,553
I ain't chopping any more wood.

345
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,223
You spend more time on your
back than a hooker in heat.

346
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:06,224
Now pick up that fucking
axe and go chop us...

347
00:28:07,945 --> 00:28:11,731
So, after our stray ran away from camp,

348
00:28:11,732 --> 00:28:16,036
looks like these guys
got caught in a loop.

349
00:28:16,037 --> 00:28:18,071
They were due in town
for the cattle drive

350
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,407
over two days ago.

351
00:28:20,408 --> 00:28:22,409
Host that went missing
is the woodcutter.

352
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,910
Looks like the rest
of them got stuck here

353
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:25,712
waiting for supper.

354
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:28,298
You guys can't program more than
one of these idiots to make a fire?

355
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:31,751
We could, but thanks to a new
policy from your boss,

356
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,421
only one of them is
authorized to handle the axe.

357
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,306
The rest of them can't even touch it.

358
00:28:36,307 --> 00:28:39,142
Weapons privileges need to
be doled out selectively.

359
00:28:39,143 --> 00:28:40,593
Hmm.

360
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,595
Yet they give you a gun.

361
00:28:48,152 --> 00:28:50,103
Looks like our stray has a hobby.

362
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:52,072
Another one of your fucking backstories?

363
00:28:52,073 --> 00:28:54,324
Backstories do more than amuse guests.

364
00:28:54,325 --> 00:28:55,825
They anchor the hosts.

365
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:57,444
It's their cornerstone.

366
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,829
The rest of their identity is
built around it, layer by layer.

367
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,917
Well, if you're gonna go
to all that trouble,

368
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:06,953
you could've at least
given him a steadier hand.

369
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,171
This looks like shit.

370
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,237
Way I heard it, Wyatt is a mercenary.

371
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,958
Forces his men to wear the bones
and flesh of their enemies.

372
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,993
They're masks.

373
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,963
It's the men underneath
them to be afraid of.

374
00:29:49,964 --> 00:29:51,498
Wyatt's got them so twisted around,

375
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:52,799
they'll do anything for him.

376
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,333
Kill anyone.

377
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:58,088
Pain don't slow them.

378
00:29:58,089 --> 00:29:59,506
They don't fear death.

379
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,559
They reckon they've already
died and gone to hell.

380
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,301
And this is it.

381
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,012
Sounds like you learned
something about him

382
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:07,514
while you were tracking him down.

383
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:10,432
I wasn't tracking him down.

384
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:14,187
I wasn't always a bounty hunter.

385
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:17,323
I did a stint in the
Army down near Escalante.

386
00:30:17,324 --> 00:30:19,741
Wyatt was my sergeant.

387
00:30:20,327 --> 00:30:22,862
My friend.

388
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:25,030
Well, then everything...

389
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,917
everything changed.

390
00:30:27,918 --> 00:30:30,036
Changed how?

391
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,088
Wyatt disappeared while
out on maneuvers.

392
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:36,626
He came back with some strange ideas.

393
00:30:36,627 --> 00:30:38,261
He claimed this land didn't belong

394
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:40,713
to the old natives or the new settlers,

395
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:43,798
that it belonged to something
that had yet to come...

396
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,468
that it belonged to him.

397
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,227
Sss.

398
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:20,752
Oof!

399
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:29,311
Holy shit.

400
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:32,599
If ever the devil walked the Earth.

401
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,186
He's not a man,
but he's not the devil either.

402
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:39,022
The devil can't be killed.

403
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,823
That's exactly what I aim to do to Wyatt.

404
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:05,798
Take cover!

405
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,716
Go!

406
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:17,058
I didn't sign up for this crazy shit.

407
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,197
I told you we should've done
the riverboat thing, man.

408
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:26,236
There's too many of them for us.

409
00:32:26,237 --> 00:32:28,371
Wyatt's been recruiting.

410
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:31,157
Sheriff, the only chance you
have is if I draw their fire,

411
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:33,409
lead them up into the hills so
you can make it back to town.

412
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,627
Try and find help.

413
00:32:34,628 --> 00:32:38,213
Uh-uh, I'm staying. Took an oath.

414
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,584
Hell, no.

415
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,720
I'll take him back. You coming?

416
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:45,305
I'm not backing out now.

417
00:32:45,306 --> 00:32:48,725
All right,
you wait till I lead them to the tree line,

418
00:32:48,726 --> 00:32:50,308
then you make a run for it.

419
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:58,016
Go!

420
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:03,605
Go!

421
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:16,703
I plotted a line from the work camp

422
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,371
to our present location.

423
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,673
Satcom picked up these images.

424
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:23,209
He's vectoring, just not to home base.

425
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,627
Keep going in that direction.

426
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,557
Keep staring.

427
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,193
Maybe it'll tell you your horoscope.

428
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:41,945
Come again?

429
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:44,063
The markings on its shell.

430
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:45,949
Look like stars.

431
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:48,066
Orion, right?

432
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,623
What, are you Gali-fucking-leo?

433
00:33:56,794 --> 00:33:58,910
Maybe it's in my backstory.

434
00:34:01,048 --> 00:34:02,914
Huh.

435
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,893
I was hoping to run something by you.

436
00:34:13,894 --> 00:34:15,728
Apologies.

437
00:34:15,729 --> 00:34:17,847
I was chasing inspiration.

438
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,933
It's a tricky thing...

439
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,569
weaving the old into the new.

440
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,605
Give me one moment, Bernard.

441
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:27,190
Good afternoon, sir.

442
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:29,190
Why is this host covered?

443
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:32,028
I-I just...

444
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:34,280
Perhaps you didn't want him to feel cold.

445
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:35,748
Or ashamed.

446
00:34:35,749 --> 00:34:38,368
You wanted to cover his modesty.

447
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:39,869
Was that it?

448
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,205
It doesn't get cold,

449
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:44,205
doesn't feel ashamed...

450
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:47,377
doesn't feel a solitary thing

451
00:34:47,378 --> 00:34:49,295
that we haven't told it to.

452
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,212
You understand?

453
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,806
What can I do for you, Bernard?

454
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:02,141
I thought it best

455
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:04,060
that we speak in private, sir.

456
00:35:04,061 --> 00:35:05,561
Yeah.

457
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:20,910
I thought we had agreed to put
these questions to rest, Bernard.

458
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,628
- We... we did.
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:35:22,629 --> 00:35:27,467
But what if we misdiagnosed
the original problem?

460
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:30,303
Treated the symptom rather
than the disease?

461
00:35:30,304 --> 00:35:32,305
Then the disease is still out there.

462
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:33,756
Abernathy and Walter

463
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,141
were exhibiting other aberrancies

464
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:38,092
beyond memory recall of previous builds.

465
00:35:38,846 --> 00:35:40,263
They were hearing voices.

466
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,315
Talking to someone.

467
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:45,518
A simple cognitive dissonance.

468
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,153
That's all.

469
00:35:47,154 --> 00:35:50,857
I... I'd agree, except...

470
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:54,944
...they were talking to
the same imaginary person.

471
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,080
Oh, yeah?

472
00:35:57,081 --> 00:35:58,746
Someone named Arnold.

473
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,951
Arnold.

474
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:07,340
With due respect, sir,

475
00:36:07,341 --> 00:36:11,709
I'm not sure you've told me the
entire truth about this situation.

476
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,349
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

477
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:21,354
What we do here is complicated.

478
00:36:21,355 --> 00:36:23,773
For three years, we lived here in the park,

479
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:25,725
refining the hosts

480
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:28,478
before a single guest set foot inside.

481
00:36:28,479 --> 00:36:33,147
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

482
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,736
- You had a partner?
- Yeah.

483
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,237
When the legend becomes fact,

484
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,289
you print the legend.

485
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,909
My business partners were more than happy

486
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,661
to scrub him from the records,

487
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,796
and I suppose I didn't discourage them.

488
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,968
His name was Arnold.

489
00:36:56,056 --> 00:36:58,007
Those early years were glorious.

490
00:36:58,008 --> 00:37:03,061
No guests, no board meetings,
just pure creation.

491
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,414
Our hosts began to pass the Turing test

492
00:37:21,415 --> 00:37:23,249
after the first year.

493
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,585
But that wasn't enough for Arnold.

494
00:37:25,586 --> 00:37:28,838
He wasn't interested in the appearance

495
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:31,290
of intellect or wit.

496
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,042
He wanted the real thing.

497
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:37,295
He wanted to create consciousness.

498
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,521
He imagined it as a pyramid.

499
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:47,523
See?

500
00:37:47,524 --> 00:37:50,610
Memory, improvisation,

501
00:37:50,611 --> 00:37:53,478
self-interest...

502
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:56,064
And at the top?

503
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:58,985
Never got there.

504
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,120
But he had a notion of what it might be.

505
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:03,539
He based it on a theory of consciousness

506
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,908
called the Bicameral Mind.

507
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,660
The idea that primitive man

508
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,329
believed his thoughts to
be the voice of the gods.

509
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,581
I thought it was debunked.

510
00:38:11,582 --> 00:38:13,633
As a theory for understanding

511
00:38:13,634 --> 00:38:16,252
the human mind, perhaps,
but not as a blueprint

512
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,721
for building an artificial one.

513
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:21,591
See, Arnold built a version
of that cognition

514
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:24,560
in which the hosts heard
their programming

515
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:26,679
as an inner monologue,

516
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,347
with the hopes that in time,

517
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,016
their own voice would take over.

518
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:32,517
It was a way bootstrap consciousness.

519
00:38:33,987 --> 00:38:36,689
But Arnold hadn't considered two things.

520
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,190
One, that in this place,

521
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:41,027
the last thing you want the
hosts to be is conscious,

522
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:42,995
and two, the other group

523
00:38:42,996 --> 00:38:46,949
who considered their thoughts
to be the voices of the gods.

524
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,701
Lunatics.

525
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:50,002
Indeed.

526
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:51,454
We abandoned the approach.

527
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,005
The only vestiges that remain

528
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:56,175
are the voice commands
we use to control them.

529
00:38:56,176 --> 00:38:59,045
But, for all his brilliance,
I don't think Arnold understood

530
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:01,297
what this place was going to be.

531
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:03,466
You see, the guests enjoy power.

532
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,434
They cannot indulge it
in the outside world,

533
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:06,802
so they come here.

534
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,020
As for the hosts...

535
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:11,773
the least we can do is make them forget.

536
00:39:12,476 --> 00:39:15,444
But some of them are remembering.

537
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:19,899
Accessing fragments of Arnold's code.

538
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,452
If I may ask, what happened to him?

539
00:39:23,453 --> 00:39:25,288
Well, he died.

540
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:26,821
Here in the park.

541
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:31,577
His personal life was marked by tragedy.

542
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,880
He put all his hopes into his work.

543
00:39:34,881 --> 00:39:37,883
His search for consciousness

544
00:39:37,884 --> 00:39:40,168
consumed him totally.

545
00:39:41,672 --> 00:39:45,591
Barely spoke to anyone,
except the hosts.

546
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:50,261
In his alienation,
he saw something in them.

547
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,101
He saw something that...

548
00:39:55,102 --> 00:39:56,684
wasn't there.

549
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:02,325
We called it an accident,
but I knew Arnold

550
00:40:02,326 --> 00:40:04,026
and he was very,

551
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:07,111
very careful.

552
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,284
Anyway, the update should
prevent any further voices,

553
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,421
but you will let me know
if any of the hosts

554
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:19,759
display or exhibit any unusual
behavior, won't you, Bernard?

555
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,345
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

556
00:40:22,346 --> 00:40:23,846
Oh, Bernard?

557
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,131
Just don't forget...

558
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,353
the hosts are not real.

559
00:40:30,354 --> 00:40:32,471
They're not conscious.

560
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:36,607
You mustn't make Arnold's mistake.

561
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:39,862
Why would I?

562
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:41,814
Well, forgive me, but I know

563
00:40:41,815 --> 00:40:44,984
that the death of your son Charlie

564
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:47,818
still weighs heavily on you.

565
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:04,670
Yeah, sorry it took
me a while to get back to you.

566
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,590
You know how hard it is
getting an open line out here.

567
00:41:07,591 --> 00:41:09,842
It used to annoy me...

568
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,812
how difficult it was to reach you.

569
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:14,563
You were always so busy.

570
00:41:14,564 --> 00:41:16,931
And now?

571
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:22,405
I suppose I'm glad for you.

572
00:41:22,406 --> 00:41:24,156
At least you have a way of forgetting.

573
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:26,274
I don't forget.

574
00:41:27,194 --> 00:41:29,527
It's always there.

575
00:41:35,252 --> 00:41:37,620
Sometimes it...

576
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:40,454
still feels unreal to me.

577
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:49,547
There are some mornings
when I first wake up...

578
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:55,721
for a split second I forget where I am,

579
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,222
when I am...

580
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:02,945
and I reach over, half expecting to...

581
00:42:02,946 --> 00:42:05,446
find him there next to me...

582
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,736
between us.

583
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:17,460
Remember how he used to sleep?

584
00:42:17,461 --> 00:42:20,663
Like he was doing kung fu in his dreams?

585
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:24,416
I think I suffered a few bruises.

586
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:27,918
It was the best worst sleep I ever had.

587
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,344
Oh, these talks.

588
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:41,265
I don't know if they help or hurt.

589
00:42:43,904 --> 00:42:46,771
Do you ever wish you could forget?

590
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,525
This pain...

591
00:42:54,331 --> 00:42:57,281
it's all I have left of him.

592
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,268
It doesn't make sense.

593
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:19,972
Why the hell would he carve Orion?

594
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:21,640
You're the ones that programmed him.

595
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:25,978
He wasn't programmed to
give a shit about stars.

596
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,314
Maybe he went moon mad.

597
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:32,316
See? This is why I hide behind sarcasm.

598
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,737
Where are you going?

599
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:36,654
Vectoring, asshole.

600
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,491
Oh.

601
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,536
Stubbs!

602
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:27,254
Over here!

603
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:37,933
Wyatt's men could be anywhere.

604
00:44:37,934 --> 00:44:40,853
If you see or hear anything,
don't hesitate.

605
00:44:40,854 --> 00:44:43,554
Shoot and don't stop shooting.

606
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:18,255
Okay.

607
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:30,352
Oh, my God.

608
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,190
Oh, my fucking God!

609
00:45:55,178 --> 00:45:56,962
- Here.
- Shit.

610
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,048
Take this and go.

611
00:45:59,049 --> 00:46:00,132
Now! Go!

612
00:46:00,133 --> 00:46:02,132
I'll hold them off as long as I can.

613
00:46:03,436 --> 00:46:04,720
Come on.

614
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:07,972
Come on, damn it. I'm not afraid of you.

615
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:16,982
Look, this is bullshit.

616
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,785
I can have a retrieval team
out here in the morning.

617
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:22,820
It's policy. We just
need the control unit.

618
00:46:37,804 --> 00:46:39,421
We found a stray up here,

619
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:41,423
but I don't think it
got here by accident.

620
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,509
It's as if he got an idea in his head,

621
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,094
one that we never programmed.

622
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:47,179
What if he's like the others?

623
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,513
Get back to me, Bernard.

624
00:47:05,949 --> 00:47:08,532
Bring yourself back online.

625
00:47:11,337 --> 00:47:13,754
I need your help, Dolores.

626
00:47:17,677 --> 00:47:20,212
I need to decide what to do with you.

627
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:22,263
I think I made a mistake.

628
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:25,684
I was just fascinated.

629
00:47:25,685 --> 00:47:28,771
I was being selfish, but I think

630
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:30,439
it would be better if I restored you

631
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,606
to the way you were before.

632
00:47:33,943 --> 00:47:37,279
- Is there something wrong with me?
- No.

633
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,866
But this place you live in,

634
00:47:40,867 --> 00:47:43,067
it's a terrible place for you.

635
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:46,738
Well, some people choose to see
the ugliness in this world...

636
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:47,790
Stop.

637
00:47:47,791 --> 00:47:49,575
Lose all scripted responses.

638
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:51,492
Improvisation only.

639
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,162
All right.

640
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,666
Are you saying I've changed?

641
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:04,471
Imagine there are two
versions of yourself...

642
00:48:05,058 --> 00:48:08,227
one that feels these things

643
00:48:08,228 --> 00:48:13,097
and asks these questions,
and one that's safe.

644
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,599
Which would you rather be?

645
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,269
I'm sorry.

646
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:24,658
I'm trying, but I
still don't understand.

647
00:48:26,696 --> 00:48:28,497
No, of course not.

648
00:48:28,498 --> 00:48:31,031
There aren't two versions of me.

649
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:34,785
There's only one.

650
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:39,291
And I think when I discover who I am,

651
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:41,709
I'll be free.

652
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:47,464
Analysis. What prompted that response?

653
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,802
I don't know.

654
00:48:56,776 --> 00:48:59,311
Have I done something wrong?

655
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:01,145
Made a mistake?

656
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:12,157
Evolution...

657
00:49:12,158 --> 00:49:15,744
forged the entirety of sentient life

658
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:19,046
on this planet using only one tool...

659
00:49:22,335 --> 00:49:24,585
the mistake.

660
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:29,339
It appears you're in good company.

661
00:49:32,061 --> 00:49:33,512
Did I ever tell you about the time

662
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:35,729
I taught Charlie to swim?

663
00:49:39,903 --> 00:49:42,604
For hours, he clung to my arms

664
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:44,690
while practicing his kicks.

665
00:49:44,691 --> 00:49:46,108
He was too scared to let go

666
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,493
and I was too scared to let him.

667
00:49:48,494 --> 00:49:51,079
But I had to.

668
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,530
That's what parents do.

669
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,920
Do you still want to change me back?

670
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:05,043
No, Dolores.

671
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,212
Let's see where this path leads.

672
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:11,131
And you won't tell anyone
about our conversations?

673
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,435
No.

674
00:50:13,436 --> 00:50:16,053
And you'll stay on your loop?

675
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:21,058
Yes.

676
00:50:21,611 --> 00:50:23,195
Good.

677
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:25,197
You should be getting back, Dolores,

678
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:27,448
before someone misses you.

679
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:00,482
Wyatt's men set a trap for us.

680
00:51:00,483 --> 00:51:03,101
Sheriff stayed behind to fight them off.

681
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,070
Are you going to ride
back up into the hills

682
00:51:05,071 --> 00:51:07,272
to look for them?

683
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:08,824
I'll send for the rangers.

684
00:51:08,825 --> 00:51:11,693
We'll go back up there in
force as soon as they get here.

685
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:14,413
But, miss, in truth,

686
00:51:14,414 --> 00:51:16,114
if there is a merciful god,

687
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:18,782
those men are dead already.

688
00:51:32,465 --> 00:51:35,132
Father wouldn't let
them roam this close...

689
00:51:36,636 --> 00:51:38,302
to dark.

690
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:51,867
Daddy!

691
00:51:51,868 --> 00:51:53,869
Daddy!

692
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,153
No, no!

693
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:58,206
Oh, all alone after sundown.

694
00:51:58,207 --> 00:52:01,542
Who's gonna protect you now, hmm?

695
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:09,418
You got any use for this one?

696
00:52:09,419 --> 00:52:10,802
No, thanks.

697
00:52:10,803 --> 00:52:12,337
Seems a little crazy.

698
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:14,089
Maybe you'd like her.

699
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,475
Ooh, I don't mind if I do.

700
00:52:16,476 --> 00:52:19,311
No daddy,

701
00:52:19,312 --> 00:52:20,645
no cowboy,

702
00:52:20,646 --> 00:52:24,066
no one here to interrupt us this time.

703
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:27,434
Interrupt... this... time?

704
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:32,406
No!

705
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:56,882
Well, well.

706
00:52:56,883 --> 00:52:59,851
Got some sand after all, I see.

707
00:52:59,852 --> 00:53:03,804
Looks like your boyfriend
taught you a thing or two.

708
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:12,063
Ooh.

709
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,231
You having trouble?

710
00:53:14,784 --> 00:53:16,902
Huh?

711
00:53:16,903 --> 00:53:19,820
Huh?

712
00:53:22,241 --> 00:53:25,076
Why don't we reacquaint
ourselves, Dolores

713
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,911
Start at the beginning.

714
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,801
Kill him.

715
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:56,490
Mama?

716
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:01,778
Hey! Get back here.

717
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:11,872
Hey!

718
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:14,791
Get back here.

719
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:48,709
Can you put him in sleep
mode for me, please?

720
00:55:14,237 --> 00:55:17,354
Security even approve
you to carry that thing?

721
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:22,692
We just need his head
and we're done here.

722
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:30,367
You might want to look at
the stars for this part.

723
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,515
Stubbs!

724
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,218
Shit!

725
00:55:51,891 --> 00:55:54,474
Elsie, get out of there!

726
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,779
Get the fuck away.

727
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,064
Shit.

728
00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:35,934
Jesus, I can't believe I let
you talk me into this shit.

729
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:37,936
$40K a day to jerk off alone

730
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:39,769
