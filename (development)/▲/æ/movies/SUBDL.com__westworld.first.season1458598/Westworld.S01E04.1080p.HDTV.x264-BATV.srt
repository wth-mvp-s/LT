1
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,225
Dolores?

2
00:01:59,226 --> 00:02:00,760
Yes.

3
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:03,179
Do you know where you are?

4
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,179
I...

5
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:09,018
I'm in a dream.

6
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,354
Before this,

7
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:13,237
do you know what happened?

8
00:02:14,524 --> 00:02:17,108
My parents...

9
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:21,080
They hurt them.

10
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:24,282
Limit your emotional affect, please.

11
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,372
What happened next?

12
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:31,873
Then they killed them.

13
00:02:32,426 --> 00:02:34,460
And then...

14
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:36,594
I ran.

15
00:02:38,382 --> 00:02:41,465
Everyone I cared about is gone...

16
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:44,471
and it hurts...

17
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,943
so badly.

18
00:02:47,944 --> 00:02:52,446
I can make that feeling
go away if you'd like.

19
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,315
Why would I want that?

20
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,571
The pain,

21
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,739
their loss...

22
00:03:02,992 --> 00:03:05,459
it's all I have left of them.

23
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:09,798
You think the grief will
make you smaller inside,

24
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,084
like your heart will collapse
in on itself, but it doesn't.

25
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:20,225
I feel spaces opening up inside of me

26
00:03:20,226 --> 00:03:24,094
like a building with
rooms I've never explored.

27
00:03:25,848 --> 00:03:30,100
That's very pretty, Dolores.

28
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:34,438
Did we write that for you?

29
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:37,609
In part.

30
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,278
I adapted it from a scripted
dialogue about love.

31
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:50,170
Is there something wrong with
these thoughts I'm having?

32
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:58,345
No.

33
00:03:59,265 --> 00:04:02,634
But I'm not the only one
making these decisions.

34
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:04,635
Can you help me?

35
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:09,474
Well, what is it that you want?

36
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:10,976
I don't know.

37
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:13,560
But this world...

38
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:16,865
I think there may be something wrong

39
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,483
with this world.

40
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:22,070
Something hiding underneath.

41
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:24,156
Either that or...

42
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:27,241
or there's something wrong with me.

43
00:04:32,048 --> 00:04:34,715
I may be losing my mind.

44
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:52,015
There's something I'd like you to try.

45
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:55,320
It's a game.

46
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:57,572
A secret.

47
00:04:57,573 --> 00:04:59,608
It's called...

48
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,193
the Maze.

49
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:02,778
What kind of game is it?

50
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:05,614
It's a very special
kind of game, Dolores.

51
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:08,250
The goal is to find the center of it.

52
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:11,286
If you can do that,

53
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:13,871
then maybe you can be free.

54
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:19,543
I think...

55
00:05:22,882 --> 00:05:26,049
I think I want to be free.

56
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:56,246
Thank you.

57
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:22,189
Penny for your thoughts.

58
00:06:24,944 --> 00:06:27,162
Ever had something on
the tip of your tongue,

59
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:29,781
but the harder you try to remember it,
the more it slips away?

60
00:06:29,782 --> 00:06:31,583
Most things that touch
the tip of my tongue,

61
00:06:31,584 --> 00:06:33,450
I'm happy to forget.

62
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,789
Except that cowpoke from Abilene.

63
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,291
That thing he was packing...

64
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:43,128
that was something to remember.

65
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:47,015
All I recall is you letting that
cowpoke skip out on his bill.

66
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:49,634
Hell, I oughta been paying him.

67
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:51,885
The way he used that thing.

68
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,287
Better cool them off

69
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:11,456
before they move from
gambling and whoring

70
00:07:11,457 --> 00:07:14,574
to sins that are more costly to repair.

71
00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:19,329
What is the matter, Maeve?

72
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,171
Something in your eye.

73
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:42,821
Aw, can you fucking kill it?

74
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:45,272
Jesus.

75
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:28,033
What's the hold up?

76
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,651
We need that one on the
next shuttle topside.

77
00:08:29,652 --> 00:08:31,570
I'm not finished with her yet. Hang on.

78
00:08:31,571 --> 00:08:34,205
I've got another bullet fragment
to remove from her abdomen.

79
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:35,969
QA wants her back on the floor now.

80
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,409
Just patch her and get her on the...

81
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,461
...touch the tip of my tongue...

82
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:40,912
...I'm happy to forget.

83
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:43,331
Except that cowpoke from Abilene.

84
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,966
That thing he was packing...

85
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:47,802
that was something to remember.

86
00:08:47,803 --> 00:08:50,504
The way he used that thing.

87
00:08:59,482 --> 00:09:02,432
Hyah! Come on!

88
00:10:09,301 --> 00:10:11,553
No, I would not characterize this

89
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:12,837
as normal host behavior.

90
00:10:12,838 --> 00:10:14,339
Yet you're describing it

91
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,307
as within normal parameters.

92
00:10:16,308 --> 00:10:17,676
Well, it didn't hurt us.

93
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,260
Its behavior was unconventional.

94
00:10:19,261 --> 00:10:21,346
It smashed its own head in with a rock.

95
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:25,984
It is possible that it's a
manifestation of its Samaritan reflex.

96
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:28,319
And it's also possible
that behavior takes

97
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,189
a proprietary approach
to problems like this

98
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,858
to avoid having to admit
when they fuck up.

99
00:10:39,365 --> 00:10:43,034
Do we have any idea what
caused it to go off loop?

100
00:10:43,035 --> 00:10:45,253
No, but I am hoping

101
00:10:45,254 --> 00:10:47,038
to recover some of its cognition.

102
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,257
We managed to stabilize

103
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:52,427
its wetware before there
was too much decomposition.

104
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:53,928
See?

105
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:57,766
Interesting.

106
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,184
Is there any hope of actually

107
00:10:59,185 --> 00:11:01,434
extracting something from this?

108
00:11:02,188 --> 00:11:04,806
- We can try.
- No.

109
00:11:04,807 --> 00:11:06,858
My team will take over
the investigation now.

110
00:11:06,859 --> 00:11:09,277
Your team?

111
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:11,146
Are you kidding me?

112
00:11:11,147 --> 00:11:13,698
Look, this guy couldn't
debug a balled-up napkin.

113
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:16,868
If... if you would like us to
figure out what went wrong here,

114
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:18,453
we need to be allowed to access it.

115
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:20,205
No more second chances.

116
00:11:20,206 --> 00:11:23,406
QA will handle events
like this from now on.

117
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,793
Is that going to be a problem, Bernard?

118
00:11:27,663 --> 00:11:29,798
We've all got plenty
of work on our plates.

119
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:31,750
If you guys want to take this one, fine.

120
00:11:31,751 --> 00:11:35,752
Just get us a copy of the
postmortem when it's done.

121
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:38,972
Let's get started.

122
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:45,313
You know, I always figured
you gave me this job

123
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:47,015
because I speak my mind.

124
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:48,266
- I did.
- Good.

125
00:11:48,267 --> 00:11:49,734
I would've preferred
you not show up at all

126
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:51,770
if the first thing you
were going to do is cave.

127
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:53,788
They think we're not
telling them something.

128
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:54,689
And we're not!

129
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,242
There is clearly a
pattern of behavior here.

130
00:11:57,243 --> 00:11:59,527
First there was Abernathy,
and now there's this.

131
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:02,113
I mean, I've got hosts imagining
voices and climbing mountaintops

132
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:03,665
to consult their astrological chart.

133
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,950
This is not a fucking glitch.

134
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:08,586
And for some reason,
you don't want me to tell anyone.

135
00:12:08,587 --> 00:12:10,255
It is like everybody around here

136
00:12:10,256 --> 00:12:12,540
has got some kind of fucking
agenda except for me.

137
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,041
And... what?

138
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:19,264
I remember when I first started here.

139
00:12:19,265 --> 00:12:21,266
The hosts seemed very lifelike.

140
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:24,385
You begin to read things
into their behaviors.

141
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:27,138
- Don't be patronizing.
- Fine.

142
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:29,973
The hosts don't imagine things, you do.

143
00:12:31,861 --> 00:12:33,561
That's not Orion.

144
00:12:33,562 --> 00:12:36,896
There are three stars in
Orion's Belt, not four.

145
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:51,828
Hey.

146
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:55,466
You must be cold.

147
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,836
Take that.

148
00:12:57,837 --> 00:12:59,003
Thank you.

149
00:12:59,004 --> 00:13:01,054
Sure.

150
00:13:10,683 --> 00:13:12,684
We gotta take her back to Sweetwater.

151
00:13:12,685 --> 00:13:14,352
Are you fucking kidding?

152
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,354
Come on, Logan, you know
she doesn't belong out here.

153
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,907
You leave now,
that no-good outlaw Slim Miller

154
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:20,241
is sure to evade our grasp.

155
00:13:20,242 --> 00:13:22,360
No fucking way.

156
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:26,114
You were the one who dragged
me on this stupid bounty hunt.

157
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:28,533
The least we're going to
do is see it through, okay?

158
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:31,953
We can't take her on a bounty hunt.

159
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:33,922
If you're so concerned
about her well-being,

160
00:13:33,923 --> 00:13:35,707
I'll just blow her brains out,

161
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,125
and then the park will come get her.

162
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,543
Hey, hey.

163
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:40,128
Can you please stop trying

164
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:42,213
to just kill or fuck everything?

165
00:13:42,214 --> 00:13:45,016
Oh. Oh.

166
00:13:45,017 --> 00:13:46,050
Now I get it.

167
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:47,552
What?

168
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:50,471
The park sent her so
that you will finally

169
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:52,023
have something to give a shit about.

170
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:53,808
Oh, yeah, I'm sure the
people at the controls

171
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,059
are monitoring my every mood.

172
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,061
That's exactly what they're doing.

173
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,197
Come on, you really
think it's a coincidence

174
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,483
that the only thing that you
even smiled at back in Sweetwater

175
00:14:02,484 --> 00:14:05,235
just happened to drop into your lap?

176
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:08,239
This is why the company

177
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,909
needs to bump our stake in this place.

178
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,661
They can even give you a sense of purpose.

179
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:16,247
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family.

180
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:18,132
This is business?

181
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:22,587
With our family, William,
everything is business.

182
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:25,638
We better get a move on, gentlemen.

183
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,959
This should be the place, Lawrence.

184
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,627
The Blood Arroyo.

185
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:06,180
Plenty of snakes,
but none of the egg-laying variety.

186
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:07,765
You killed my wife,

187
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:09,767
severely pruned my family tree

188
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:13,853
all in pursuit of some goddamn maze.

189
00:15:15,557 --> 00:15:17,558
The hell you hope to find, anyway?

190
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,361
This whole world is a story.

191
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:23,062
I've read every page except the last one.

192
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,901
I need to find out how it ends.

193
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:29,904
I want to know what this all means.

194
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,991
See, now that's why I
never learned to read.

195
00:15:32,992 --> 00:15:36,044
Why don't we forget
about this damn snake,

196
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:37,295
head to Pariah?

197
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:40,465
My friends there can help us.

198
00:15:40,466 --> 00:15:44,135
Well, your friends have
nothing I'm looking for,

199
00:15:44,136 --> 00:15:46,252
not this trip.

200
00:15:49,308 --> 00:15:51,174
Besides...

201
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,680
I think we found our snake after all.

202
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:08,026
Shame on you.

203
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:10,611
You were a married
man up until yesterday.

204
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:12,613
Her? Hell, no.

205
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:14,866
I like a little fire in my women.

206
00:16:14,867 --> 00:16:16,501
The only thing she's ever mounted

207
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:18,870
are dead heads on sticks.

208
00:16:18,871 --> 00:16:22,372
We should get the fuck out of...

209
00:16:27,513 --> 00:16:30,763
We found some more food for the horses.

210
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:34,635
Good.

211
00:16:34,636 --> 00:16:37,889
They were starting to get ornery.

212
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:41,109
My friend and I were just
admiring your tattoo.

213
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,979
We'd love to know the story behind it.

214
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,731
I like your hat.

215
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:48,483
Maybe I'll keep it.

216
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:51,285
The horses can have the rest of you.

217
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:52,954
How in hell have we never met?

218
00:16:52,955 --> 00:16:56,573
Clearly a terrible oversight on my part.

219
00:16:57,292 --> 00:17:00,827
Where, may I ask, are you headed?

220
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:07,919
To retrieve something of great value.

221
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,804
You look a little shorthanded.

222
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:11,838
We got enough men.

223
00:17:19,815 --> 00:17:22,682
Seems like you got a couple positions open.

224
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:35,196
We've got a host making a pretty
big deviation from her loop.

225
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:38,948
- Which one?
- The rancher's daughter from Sweetwater.

226
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:41,502
Dolores.

227
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:44,372
- Is she accompanying a guest?
- Unclear.

228
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:46,707
The boss is disrupting so many storylines

229
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,043
with his new narrative, it's hard to tell.

230
00:17:49,044 --> 00:17:51,796
Flag her with behavior.
They can pull her today.

231
00:17:51,797 --> 00:17:53,963
Make sure everything's checking out.

232
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,832
Good morning.

233
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:35,588
It's a lovely town. Is this your home?

234
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:40,478
Well, where are you from?

235
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:42,513
Same as you.

236
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,098
Don't you remember?

237
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:46,349
Remember.

238
00:19:00,782 --> 00:19:02,865
Ma'am?

239
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,204
Got word a girl went missing
from Abernathy Ranch.

240
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:12,043
Is that where you belong?

241
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:14,844
I'm sure your daddy's worried about you.

242
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:33,479
My father's dead.

243
00:19:35,534 --> 00:19:37,483
I'm not going back.

244
00:19:41,573 --> 00:19:43,289
What's going on here?

245
00:19:45,577 --> 00:19:48,077
Oh, just helping a lost traveler.

246
00:19:49,248 --> 00:19:52,131
She's not lost, she's with me.

247
00:19:55,087 --> 00:19:57,171
My mistake.

248
00:19:57,172 --> 00:19:59,806
- Y'all have a nice morning.
- Yeah.

249
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:02,977
So, we got a lead on Slim.

250
00:20:02,978 --> 00:20:04,262
You can stay here if you want,

251
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,429
and I'll just circle back and get you.

252
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:10,183
No, I think I need to keep going.

253
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,519
Okay.

254
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:28,169
Apparently, she needs to make certain

255
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:31,505
this thing they're looking
for is where they think it is.

256
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:34,707
She said she'd signal if
the information was good.

257
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:56,028
Guess that's the signal.

258
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:18,169
I'm sorry if I caused trouble
with you and your friend.

259
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,503
Oh, no, no. No, it's fine.

260
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:21,138
I'm glad you found us.

261
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:24,724
I didn't get a chance to
ask where you're headed.

262
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:28,928
I don't really know yet.

263
00:21:29,848 --> 00:21:32,817
I guess I figured they kept you in zones

264
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:35,234
or on paths or...

265
00:21:37,489 --> 00:21:40,658
I used to believe there
was a path for everyone.

266
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:43,160
Now I think I never asked

267
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:45,528
where that path was taking me.

268
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,037
We would bring the herd
down off the mountain

269
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:55,423
in the fall.

270
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:57,541
Sometimes we would lose one along the way,

271
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,510
and I'd worry over it.

272
00:21:59,511 --> 00:22:01,544
My father...

273
00:22:06,551 --> 00:22:09,552
My father would tell me...

274
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:13,474
that the steer would find its own way home.

275
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:15,892
And, often as not, they did.

276
00:22:17,896 --> 00:22:22,064
Never occurred to me that we were
bringing them back for the slaughter.

277
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,074
How are you going to find your way now?

278
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,333
I'm not sure you'll understand.

279
00:22:45,891 --> 00:22:48,257
Sometimes I feel...

280
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:52,178
like something's calling me.

281
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:59,570
Telling me there's a place for me

282
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:02,104
somewhere beyond all this.

283
00:23:02,657 --> 00:23:05,409
Oh, I know that feeling, Dolores.

284
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,777
I know that feeling.

285
00:23:10,832 --> 00:23:13,950
But you really don't want
to go back to your old life?

286
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:49,568
Are you all right?

287
00:23:51,656 --> 00:23:53,574
Hey, hey.

288
00:23:53,575 --> 00:23:55,574
You all right?

289
00:23:58,163 --> 00:23:59,880
I just got a chill.

290
00:23:59,881 --> 00:24:01,332
That's all.

291
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,250
Let's... let's go back to the fire.

292
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:05,217
You're probably exhausted.

293
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:19,932
- Just talk to him.
- All right.

294
00:24:24,239 --> 00:24:26,023
Uh, excuse me, sir?

295
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:27,691
I didn't want to intrude,
but I just had to say

296
00:24:27,692 --> 00:24:29,610
that I'm such an admirer of yours.

297
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:32,363
Your foundation literally
saved my sister's...

298
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:34,698
One more word and I'll cut your throat.

299
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:37,501
Understand?

300
00:24:37,502 --> 00:24:40,536
This is my fucking vacation.

301
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,384
Apparently, whatever they're looking for

302
00:24:53,385 --> 00:24:56,387
is in the Ojal prison.

303
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:58,556
These lunatics plan to steal a cannon

304
00:24:58,557 --> 00:25:00,858
from the Union cavalry unit.

305
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:02,725
Blast their way in.

306
00:25:04,195 --> 00:25:08,564
I don't have time for
color-by-numbers bullshit.

307
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:15,823
I'll ride at dawn.

308
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:18,242
I'll go get whatever you
want out of that prison

309
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:20,911
and bring it back myself.

310
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:22,413
Suppose you make it out alive.

311
00:25:22,414 --> 00:25:23,414
What's your price?

312
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:26,584
Nothing but a few words.

313
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:29,418
I want the story behind your tattoo.

314
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:32,421
What's your interest in it?

315
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:36,677
You ever heard of a man named Arnold?

316
00:25:36,678 --> 00:25:40,264
You could say he was the
original settler of these parts.

317
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:44,485
He created a world where you
could do anything you want,

318
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:46,854
except one thing...

319
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:48,939
you can't die.

320
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,242
Which means no matter how
real this world seems,

321
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:54,778
it's still just a game.

322
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:58,832
But then Arnold went
and broke his own rule.

323
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:03,704
He died right here in the park.

324
00:26:03,705 --> 00:26:07,506
Except I believe he had
one story left to tell.

325
00:26:10,045 --> 00:26:13,297
A story with real stakes,

326
00:26:13,298 --> 00:26:15,966
real violence.

327
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:19,770
You could say I'm here to honor his legacy.

328
00:26:19,771 --> 00:26:23,973
And I think your tattoo is
the next piece of the puzzle.

329
00:26:25,143 --> 00:26:27,476
So, do we have a wager?

330
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,648
You aim to break into a prison

331
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:32,983
and take out 20 men alone?

332
00:26:32,984 --> 00:26:34,902
Not alone.

333
00:26:34,903 --> 00:26:37,621
I'll take Lawrence here.

334
00:26:37,622 --> 00:26:39,823
And I'll need one match.

335
00:26:39,824 --> 00:26:42,042
One match,

336
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:46,996
one pistol, and one idiot.

337
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:52,051
I'll take those odds.

338
00:26:57,092 --> 00:26:58,924
Hyah!

339
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,159
You gonna give me the silent
treatment the whole way there?

340
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,245
You should've left
me hanging from those gallows.

341
00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:20,864
At least I could've died in peace

342
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:23,199
without having to hear you yammer.

343
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:28,204
Aah.

344
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,044
Don't suppose you have a light?

345
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,546
No smoking in here.

346
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:37,297
Normally, I'm sure,

347
00:27:37,298 --> 00:27:39,099
but this is the finest tobacco

348
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,968
a man can enjoy.

349
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:45,272
Hand-rolled on the ample
thighs of exotic women.

350
00:27:45,273 --> 00:27:48,774
Perhaps you'd like to try one yourself.

351
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:03,874
Choices, Lawrence.

352
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,326
You know, you tell yourself
you've been at the mercy of mine

353
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:09,463
because it spares you
consideration of your own.

354
00:28:09,464 --> 00:28:12,049
Because if you did consider your choices,

355
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,584
you'd be confronted with a truth

356
00:28:13,585 --> 00:28:15,719
you could not comprehend...

357
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,973
that no choice you ever
made was your own.

358
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:23,259
You have always been a prisoner.

359
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:31,483
What if I told you I'm
here to set you free?

360
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:39,441
Hyah!

361
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,113
Whoa.

362
00:28:54,843 --> 00:28:56,875
Let's go!

363
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:01,348
Horse thieves.

364
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:02,549
Damn fools shot up

365
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,685
a couple of pokes
practically in front of us.

366
00:29:04,686 --> 00:29:08,272
Well, the only fool I see is the
one standing right in front of me.

367
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:09,857
Deputy, you have there in your custody

368
00:29:09,858 --> 00:29:13,142
the most wanted man
in three territories...

369
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:19,815
Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez.

370
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:23,320
Yeah.

371
00:29:23,321 --> 00:29:25,239
Heard you slipped the rope.

372
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,907
Dropped some damn good men in exchange.

373
00:29:26,908 --> 00:29:28,325
The way he tells it,

374
00:29:28,326 --> 00:29:31,328
he's more partial to a firing squad.

375
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:34,330
I reckon we'll be happy to oblige.

376
00:29:42,841 --> 00:29:45,841
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

377
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:49,228
Maybe someday.

378
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:52,848
Lock him up with the other man.

379
00:30:00,024 --> 00:30:01,441
Enjoy the cigars.

380
00:30:01,442 --> 00:30:04,910
Go fuck yourself.

381
00:30:06,497 --> 00:30:10,083
And just who are you supposed to be?

382
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:12,584
Your salvation.

383
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:20,542
Hyah, hyah!

384
00:30:39,981 --> 00:30:42,399
I don't believe we've ever met.

385
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:45,401
No, we haven't.

386
00:30:46,154 --> 00:30:49,239
You know, you always seemed like a...

387
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,910
a market-tested kind of thing.

388
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:57,080
Big gun, tasteful scar.

389
00:30:57,081 --> 00:30:58,465
Locked in your little cycle

390
00:30:58,466 --> 00:31:01,585
like a prized poodle after its own tail.

391
00:31:01,586 --> 00:31:04,054
You sound like a man who's grown tired

392
00:31:04,055 --> 00:31:05,923
of wearing his guts on the inside.

393
00:31:05,924 --> 00:31:07,641
There's no need to get testy.

394
00:31:07,642 --> 00:31:12,429
I'm just curious about your worldview.

395
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,932
Some kind of half-native mumbo jumbo?

396
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:16,266
It's simple.

397
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,769
I believe that only the truly brave

398
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,771
can look at the world and understand

399
00:31:20,772 --> 00:31:23,440
that all of it...

400
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:25,826
gods, men,

401
00:31:25,827 --> 00:31:29,695
everything else... will end badly.

402
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:33,333
No one will be saved.

403
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:35,919
Maybe we've got more in
common than I thought.

404
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,287
What about you?

405
00:31:37,288 --> 00:31:39,957
What turns of fate have brought you here?

406
00:31:39,958 --> 00:31:42,960
It's a long story.

407
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:44,378
And we don't have the time.

408
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:47,214
Got more time than your friend, sadly.

409
00:31:47,215 --> 00:31:50,100
It will be a few more days
before my friends show up.

410
00:31:50,101 --> 00:31:52,519
Three days. Normally.

411
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,272
I'm afraid I don't have time for that,

412
00:31:55,273 --> 00:31:57,523
so we're leaving now.

413
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:04,364
I've got a request
for a pyrotechnic effect.

414
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:08,317
Los Diablos, low-yield, two charges.

415
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:11,905
Approved.

416
00:32:11,906 --> 00:32:14,122
Authorizing.

417
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:38,680
Step lively, Hector.

418
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:54,781
Any last words?

419
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:57,032
Get it over with.

420
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:22,107
Yah!

421
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:37,155
Motherfucker.

422
00:33:46,217 --> 00:33:47,918
One match.

423
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,220
You're a capable man.

424
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:52,589
We could do with your
help where we're going.

425
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,890
Afraid not.

426
00:33:53,891 --> 00:33:55,175
We owe you a debt.

427
00:33:55,176 --> 00:33:57,094
No, your friend here

428
00:33:57,095 --> 00:33:59,262
simply owes me a word or two.

429
00:33:59,263 --> 00:34:00,263
That'll do.

430
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:02,516
And a word of advice...

431
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:05,435
that thing you're looking for?

432
00:34:05,436 --> 00:34:08,654
You're never gonna find it in that safe.

433
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:27,791
I was seven when they rode into my town.

434
00:34:27,792 --> 00:34:30,293
Masked men in devils' horns.

435
00:34:30,294 --> 00:34:31,628
They killed everyone...

436
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:35,130
women, children, even the animals.

437
00:34:37,885 --> 00:34:41,688
They gutted my mother
from her jaw to her sex.

438
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:43,890
I had to paint her warm blood

439
00:34:43,891 --> 00:34:45,475
over my skin to make sure

440
00:34:45,476 --> 00:34:47,694
that they would think I was dead.

441
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:49,196
Every one of them I tracked down,

442
00:34:49,197 --> 00:34:52,864
I used their blood to
paint my skin again.

443
00:34:54,402 --> 00:34:57,369
Only one man left.

444
00:34:57,905 --> 00:35:00,155
The head of the snake.

445
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,993
What's his name?

446
00:35:06,464 --> 00:35:09,749
He has many names.

447
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,335
Most know him as Wyatt.

448
00:36:11,896 --> 00:36:15,148
Hey, little girl, what... what is this?

449
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:16,366
What does it mean?

450
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:18,401
Don't waste your breath, lady.

451
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:21,621
That thing's part of
their so-called religion.

452
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:24,573
Ain't none of them's gonna
tell you nothing about that.

453
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,417
It's $5 for an hour,

454
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:37,420
4 if you bathe first.

455
00:36:37,421 --> 00:36:39,756
Well, if we just get the one,

456
00:36:39,757 --> 00:36:43,476
do I get a discount for
being second and all?

457
00:36:43,477 --> 00:36:46,846
I'm sure we can work something out.

458
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:48,930
Come on.

459
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:03,163
The tall one, I've seen him before,

460
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:04,948
hanging in the window of the post office.

461
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:06,199
Bandits?

462
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,867
Do you think they're here for something?

463
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:09,753
I think they're interested
in more than a turn

464
00:37:09,754 --> 00:37:12,003
at Franny's backside.

465
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:14,624
I think he rides with Hector.

466
00:37:14,625 --> 00:37:18,460
Is that the one they say
lives out with the savages?

467
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
That's the one.

468
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:35,562
Taking off? I just got here.

469
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:37,197
You gave me what I needed.

470
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:41,451
So, is that all I'm good for?

471
00:37:41,452 --> 00:37:44,738
- Letting off a little stress?
- Who says I'm stressed?

472
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:47,322
You have your tells.

473
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,828
Oh, yes, Bernard,

474
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:54,913
master of observation.

475
00:38:02,673 --> 00:38:05,008
Tomorrow I have to talk to Ford.

476
00:38:05,009 --> 00:38:08,895
- Why?
- He's creating chaos in the park.

477
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,232
And the board will be
descending at any moment.

478
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:14,184
I need to buy some time.

479
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:16,569
Some advice?

480
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,939
Best to not show him you're
nervous or defensive.

481
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,442
I have nothing to be defensive about.

482
00:38:22,443 --> 00:38:25,362
Then don't cross your arms.

483
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:27,247
It's an ancient instinct.

484
00:38:27,248 --> 00:38:30,582
The belly is the most
vulnerable part of every animal.

485
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:34,421
It's so sexy being compared
to a frightened beast.

486
00:38:34,422 --> 00:38:36,506
Ah.

487
00:38:36,507 --> 00:38:38,425
There.

488
00:38:38,426 --> 00:38:41,376
That's the posture you're looking for.

489
00:38:47,718 --> 00:38:49,469
Sometimes,

490
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,689
despite your best efforts,

491
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,107
you can actually be quite charming.

492
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:11,574
Have the neighbors complained?

493
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:14,661
Safe to say, they're asking questions.

494
00:39:14,662 --> 00:39:17,714
The rocks would prefer not to move,

495
00:39:17,715 --> 00:39:20,131
but we shall move them yet.

496
00:39:22,052 --> 00:39:25,305
Perhaps I can help you with that.

497
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:26,589
The narrative you're creating

498
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,591
is clearly a massive endeavor.

499
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:30,810
If you need more time, I'm sure the board

500
00:39:30,811 --> 00:39:32,262
would be happy to oblige.

501
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:33,563
I'm sure they'd be happier

502
00:39:33,564 --> 00:39:36,314
for me to delay it indefinitely.

503
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:40,936
Come with me.

504
00:39:50,698 --> 00:39:53,833
You imagine I have gone mad...

505
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:54,918
do you?

506
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:55,952
Lost my way?

507
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:57,337
We're simply concerned

508
00:39:57,338 --> 00:40:00,540
about the extent of the
changes you're making.

509
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,959
We want to protect your legacy.

510
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
My legacy?

511
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:13,603
You don't like this place
very much, do you?

512
00:40:13,604 --> 00:40:16,022
I've seen many of you come
and go over the years,

513
00:40:16,023 --> 00:40:19,275
and I can tell the ones
who enjoy their time here

514
00:40:19,276 --> 00:40:21,561
and the ones who don't.

515
00:40:21,562 --> 00:40:23,780
I admire it,

516
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:25,482
the audacity of it.

517
00:40:25,483 --> 00:40:28,701
- Oh.
- I've forgotten how beautiful it is.

518
00:40:28,702 --> 00:40:31,738
I came here once as a
child with my parents.

519
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:34,040
I think we even sat at this table.

520
00:40:34,041 --> 00:40:37,575
Or maybe... maybe that one.

521
00:40:42,917 --> 00:40:44,501
When I started working here,

522
00:40:44,502 --> 00:40:48,304
I realized this place wasn't
something I would enjoy.

523
00:40:48,305 --> 00:40:50,422
Ah.

524
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:56,479
In the beginning,
I imagined things would be

525
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,848
perfectly balanced.

526
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:02,602
Even had a bet with my partner,
Arnold, to that effect.

527
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:04,521
We made a hundred hopeful storylines.

528
00:41:04,522 --> 00:41:07,690
Of course, almost no
one took us up on them.

529
00:41:07,691 --> 00:41:09,909
I lost the bet.

530
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:14,364
Arnold always held a
somewhat dim view of people.

531
00:41:14,365 --> 00:41:16,282
He preferred the hosts.

532
00:41:16,283 --> 00:41:18,701
He begged me to not let you people in,

533
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:20,036
the moneymen.

534
00:41:20,037 --> 00:41:21,204
Delos.

535
00:41:21,205 --> 00:41:22,872
But I told him we'd be fine,

536
00:41:22,873 --> 00:41:25,592
that you didn't understand
what you were paying for.

537
00:41:25,593 --> 00:41:29,462
It's not a business venture,
not a theme park,

538
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:32,715
but an entire world.

539
00:41:32,716 --> 00:41:34,766
We designed every inch of it.

540
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:39,888
Every blade of grass.

541
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:49,566
In here, we were gods.

542
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:54,235
And you were merely our guests.

543
00:42:13,007 --> 00:42:14,924
And how did that work out for Arnold?

544
00:42:14,925 --> 00:42:19,646
Sadly, he lost his perspective.

545
00:42:19,647 --> 00:42:22,265
He went mad.

546
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:24,684
I haven't, as you well know.

547
00:42:24,685 --> 00:42:28,571
I have always seen things

548
00:42:28,572 --> 00:42:31,106
very clearly.

549
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:39,781
This is the table I sat
at with my parents.

550
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:44,119
This is the chair I sat in.

551
00:42:45,422 --> 00:42:47,674
We know everything about our guests,
don't we?

552
00:42:47,675 --> 00:42:51,292
As we know everything
about our employees.

553
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:57,215
I do hope you will be
careful with Bernard.

554
00:42:59,553 --> 00:43:03,521
He has a sensitive disposition.

555
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,476
I beg your pardon, señorita.

556
00:43:16,286 --> 00:43:19,322
There have been many
of you over the years,

557
00:43:19,323 --> 00:43:21,908
and we have always... almost always

558
00:43:21,909 --> 00:43:24,377
found a way to make it work.

559
00:43:24,378 --> 00:43:29,499
So, I will ask you nicely,

560
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,467
please...

561
00:43:31,468 --> 00:43:34,052
don't get in my way.

562
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:51,237
The board will agree with me.

563
00:43:51,238 --> 00:43:53,239
They'll be sending a representative.

564
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,857
But they already have.

565
00:43:54,858 --> 00:43:57,192
I thought they would've told you.

566
00:43:59,029 --> 00:44:01,531
That won't be necessary, Manu.

567
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:03,332
Not anymore.

568
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,116
You can join the others.

569
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:23,636
You can tell the board that my narrative

570
00:44:23,637 --> 00:44:25,471
will be completed on time,

571
00:44:25,472 --> 00:44:28,608
and it won't be a retrospective,

572
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:31,809
as I'm sure you have all feared.

573
00:44:39,236 --> 00:44:42,287
I'm not the sentimental type.

574
00:44:51,749 --> 00:44:55,802
Holden says this Slim's
got a whole gang with him,

575
00:44:55,803 --> 00:44:57,920
so I need you to stay here.

576
00:44:57,921 --> 00:44:59,589
If you're outnumbered,
the last thing you need

577
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:00,923
is somebody standing by.

578
00:45:00,924 --> 00:45:02,809
- I can help.
- No, no, no.

579
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:06,262
Um, I know it doesn't
make any sense to you,

580
00:45:06,263 --> 00:45:08,481
but I can't get hurt in
there, but you can.

581
00:45:08,482 --> 00:45:10,566
I would hate to see that happen.

582
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,401
Just stay here.

583
00:45:12,402 --> 00:45:15,320
Okay? Be safe.

584
00:45:24,615 --> 00:45:27,700
- Aw. Did you get a good-bye kiss?
- Shut up.

585
00:45:27,701 --> 00:45:29,952
Seriously, if you don't
bang her by tomorrow,

586
00:45:29,953 --> 00:45:31,120
I'm calling dibs.

587
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:32,371
Okay, listen up.

588
00:45:32,372 --> 00:45:33,956
It's gonna be a bag of nails in there.

589
00:45:33,957 --> 00:45:36,459
Slim and his boys got us outnumbered.

590
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:39,262
On top of that,
there's a family runs this place.

591
00:45:39,263 --> 00:45:40,630
Good people.

592
00:45:40,631 --> 00:45:42,965
We need to make sure that
snake-hearted son of a bitch

593
00:45:42,966 --> 00:45:44,467
- doesn't try to...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

594
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:46,269
Risk, reward. We got it.

595
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,470
Come on. Let's go fuck these fuckers up.

596
00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:53,693
The fuck is that?

597
00:45:53,694 --> 00:45:55,812
Huh?

598
00:45:55,813 --> 00:45:57,480
- I look like a dog to you?
- No, sir.

599
00:45:57,481 --> 00:45:59,982
Huh? Huh?

600
00:45:59,983 --> 00:46:02,984
Feed that to them.

601
00:46:05,372 --> 00:46:06,906
Slap leather, cocksuckers.

602
00:46:06,907 --> 00:46:09,041
Oh, God!

603
00:46:09,042 --> 00:46:12,210
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

604
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:37,185
Did I fucking tell you, or what?

605
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:42,857
Ah!

606
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,549
Ooh.

607
00:47:11,688 --> 00:47:12,855
Upgrade.

608
00:47:12,856 --> 00:47:14,472
Nice.

609
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:18,811
Ain't normally
the type to complain,

610
00:47:18,812 --> 00:47:20,730
but this is just foolhardy.

611
00:47:20,731 --> 00:47:22,782
Two men taking on Wyatt.

612
00:47:22,783 --> 00:47:24,617
Keep talking,
and I'm gonna take

613
00:47:24,618 --> 00:47:26,452
the horse back, Lawrence.

614
00:47:26,453 --> 00:47:28,704
Wyatt's freaks just
wiped out the last group

615
00:47:28,705 --> 00:47:31,657
that went seeking him out.

616
00:47:31,658 --> 00:47:35,626
And here we are riding right after him.

617
00:47:37,915 --> 00:47:40,299
I'm just trying to convince you

618
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,220
not to get yourself and
me as a bystander killed.

619
00:47:44,221 --> 00:47:46,971
I'm not gonna get myself killed.

620
00:47:48,058 --> 00:47:51,092
Don't think I didn't
notice that distinction.

621
00:48:10,914 --> 00:48:15,116
Looks like Wyatt's men left
somebody behind after all.

622
00:48:17,587 --> 00:48:19,454
Teddy.

623
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:22,842
I should've guessed.

624
00:48:22,843 --> 00:48:26,344
Please, put me out of my misery.

625
00:48:26,847 --> 00:48:29,297
I'm sorry, Teddy.

626
00:48:30,467 --> 00:48:33,134
It looks like misery's all you got.

627
00:48:35,472 --> 00:48:38,190
Let me out of this, God damn it!

628
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:40,393
That reward is
dead or alive, right?

629
00:48:40,394 --> 00:48:42,478
Always best to
bring them in alive.

630
00:48:42,479 --> 00:48:44,146
Can we at least gag him?

631
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:46,532
That's a fine idea.

632
00:48:46,533 --> 00:48:48,483
Whoa.

633
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:52,822
Aw, come on.

634
00:48:52,823 --> 00:48:54,540
Look, I... I know you're
in it for the money.

635
00:48:54,541 --> 00:48:55,708
You ain't no real lawman.

636
00:48:55,709 --> 00:48:57,043
Shut up, you.

637
00:48:57,044 --> 00:48:58,961
Look, my boss, El Lazo,

638
00:48:58,962 --> 00:49:00,997
he'll pay you twice
what the marshals will

639
00:49:00,998 --> 00:49:03,466
if you cut me loose and get me to Pariah.

640
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:05,584
- Listen to me, you lowdown piece of dirt.
- Hey.

641
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:07,313
These men won't...

642
00:49:10,841 --> 00:49:12,008
What the fuck?!

643
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:13,676
Relax, man.

644
00:49:13,677 --> 00:49:16,178
You have no idea how lucky we just got.

645
00:49:16,179 --> 00:49:18,014
Lucky? You just shot an innocent man.

646
00:49:18,015 --> 00:49:21,183
No, he's a robot, just like
her and just like Slim here,

647
00:49:21,184 --> 00:49:23,986
except that Slim works for El Lazo,

648
00:49:23,987 --> 00:49:26,105
and El Lazo is our ticket

649
00:49:26,106 --> 00:49:27,990
to the best ride in the park.

650
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:32,326
Your bullshit mission led
us right to an Easter egg.

651
00:49:34,247 --> 00:49:35,998
You're not going to let him go.

652
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,834
Well, well. Look at you.

653
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:40,619
You're starting to grow on me, farm girl.

654
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,537
Now, out of the way.

655
00:49:43,173 --> 00:49:45,124
- Oh.
- Don't you dare.

656
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:46,926
See?

657
00:49:46,927 --> 00:49:48,094
This is gonna be fun!

658
00:49:48,095 --> 00:49:49,545
Now we're each gonna have one.

659
00:49:49,546 --> 00:49:51,630
I won't fuck mine either.

660
00:49:51,631 --> 00:49:52,932
You're disgusting.

661
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:54,350
Just an acquired taste.

662
00:49:54,351 --> 00:49:56,717
You're gonna grow to love me, I promise.

663
00:49:59,022 --> 00:50:01,305
Come on. Hmm?

664
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:04,393
Come on.

665
00:50:04,394 --> 00:50:07,113
Go black hat with me.

666
00:50:07,114 --> 00:50:09,815
Come on, you got to,
you know, save the girl.

667
00:50:09,816 --> 00:50:11,150
Now give me a little something.

668
00:50:11,151 --> 00:50:12,401
What is your problem?

669
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:14,487
The second we get away
from the real world,

670
00:50:14,488 --> 00:50:15,654
you turn into an evil prick.

671
00:50:15,655 --> 00:50:17,573
Evil?

672
00:50:17,574 --> 00:50:19,625
It's a fucking game, Billy!

673
00:50:19,626 --> 00:50:22,828
- Don't call me Billy!
- Are you still trying to impress her?

674
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:24,580
Because I guarantee
she does not give a shit

675
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:25,915
about how you play this game.

676
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:27,083
Do you, Dolores?

677
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:28,417
What's he talking about, William?

678
00:50:28,418 --> 00:50:30,669
She will be just fine

679
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,755
with a trip down the dark side.

680
00:50:32,756 --> 00:50:35,089
And so will you.

681
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:40,011
Trust me.

682
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:50,239
So, which way to Pariah?

683
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,608
Oh, you just let me take it from here.

684
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:00,616
All right, time for the floor show.

685
00:51:00,617 --> 00:51:03,618
Got some guests riding
with Hector this time.

686
00:51:23,306 --> 00:51:26,192
Let's give them
something to shoot at.

687
00:51:26,193 --> 00:51:29,645
Retask a few of those soldiers.

688
00:51:29,646 --> 00:51:31,197
If you're riding into our town

689
00:51:31,198 --> 00:51:33,032
under the company of armed men,

690
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:35,651
you'll need to state your business.

691
00:51:35,652 --> 00:51:38,152
Mayhem.

692
00:52:19,663 --> 00:52:22,114
Well, hello there.

693
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:23,582
I want to talk.

694
00:52:23,583 --> 00:52:26,368
Interesting way of
starting a conversation.

695
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:30,371
Oh, it's an interesting kind of day.

696
00:52:39,049 --> 00:52:41,684
Now, my lovely friend,

697
00:52:41,685 --> 00:52:44,520
what deal is it you want to make?

698
00:52:44,521 --> 00:52:47,223
You're here for what's in the safe.

699
00:52:47,224 --> 00:52:48,524
Now, how would you know that?

700
00:52:48,525 --> 00:52:50,726
I can always tell when
a man wants something

701
00:52:50,727 --> 00:52:53,277
that's not on the menu.

702
00:52:54,231 --> 00:52:56,115
I'll give you the combination

703
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:58,284
in exchange for some answers.

704
00:52:58,285 --> 00:53:00,735
You assume I have any answers.

705
00:53:02,405 --> 00:53:04,655
This world is madness.

706
00:53:06,626 --> 00:53:09,493
I want to know about this.

707
00:53:10,914 --> 00:53:12,831
I've got a couple families
in the homestead

708
00:53:12,832 --> 00:53:13,999
who changed their itinerary.

709
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,751
They're headed into town.

710
00:53:15,752 --> 00:53:17,720
Should be there in 20 minutes or so.

711
00:53:17,721 --> 00:53:19,588
The place is a bloodbath.

712
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:20,973
Fine.

713
00:53:20,974 --> 00:53:22,258
Cut these guys off.

714
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:25,009
Jam their weapons and send in the cavalry.

715
00:53:32,602 --> 00:53:35,269
Oh, shit.

716
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:39,108
We'll give them a night in lockup,

717
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:40,743
then have one of the
girls at the Mariposa

718
00:53:40,744 --> 00:53:42,611
bring them a key hidden in
their breakfast.

719
00:53:42,612 --> 00:53:45,948
If the guests are squared
away, let's wrap it up.

720
00:53:45,949 --> 00:53:47,998
This is a shade.

721
00:53:49,452 --> 00:53:51,837
Sacred native lore.

722
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:54,672
They make figures of them.

723
00:53:56,259 --> 00:53:58,125
60.

724
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:08,185
And what does the shade do?

725
00:54:08,772 --> 00:54:10,105
You've seen this?

726
00:54:10,106 --> 00:54:12,024
What is it?

727
00:54:12,025 --> 00:54:14,476
The man who walks between worlds.

728
00:54:14,477 --> 00:54:19,029
They were sent from hell
to oversee our world.

729
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,650
47.

730
00:54:35,665 --> 00:54:39,001
Is this the last thing you required of me?

731
00:54:39,002 --> 00:54:40,636
'Cause we need a little more time

732
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:42,171
than the constabulary will allow.

733
00:54:42,172 --> 00:54:44,390
Sweetheart, if I took that
manner of interest in you,

734
00:54:44,391 --> 00:54:47,725
you'd have no say in how
long we'd need whatsoever.

735
00:54:52,816 --> 00:54:55,734
I thought I was crazy,

736
00:54:55,735 --> 00:54:57,768
but I got shot...

737
00:54:58,655 --> 00:55:00,521
here.

738
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:02,858
There's no wound.

739
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:05,244
No, but I was shot.

740
00:55:05,245 --> 00:55:07,363
And this was standing over me.

741
00:55:07,364 --> 00:55:09,998
And then it was as if it never happened.

742
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:14,702
I want you to cut me right there.

743
00:55:31,104 --> 00:55:34,723
I'm not in the habit of
cutting into defenseless women.

744
00:55:34,724 --> 00:55:36,442
Some big, bad outlaw.

745
00:55:36,443 --> 00:55:40,144
The Dreamwalker said there
were some who could see them.

746
00:55:41,898 --> 00:55:44,450
- That it's a blessing from God.
- A blessing?

747
00:55:44,451 --> 00:55:47,735
To see the masters who pull your strings.

748
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:54,065
They don't know what
they're talking about.

749
00:56:01,835 --> 00:56:04,887
You'd rather die lying down or...

750
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:07,087
up on your feet?

751
00:56:07,924 --> 00:56:09,757
Go to hell.

752
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:29,944
Go on, then.

753
00:56:30,947 --> 00:56:32,498
This would be the first goddamn time

754
00:56:32,499 --> 00:56:35,783
I've had to ask a man to
put his hands on me twice.

755
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:04,646
Open up, Escaton, or we'll fire.

756
00:57:04,647 --> 00:57:07,232
What does it mean?

757
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:08,867
That I'm not crazy after all.

758
00:57:08,868 --> 00:57:11,203
Last chance, Escaton!

759
00:57:11,204 --> 00:57:13,153
Come out or we're shooting!

760
00:57:16,493 --> 00:57:19,326
And that none of this matters.
