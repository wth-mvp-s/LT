1
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:54,872
You got any stories, friend?

2
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:00,133
Yeah, I suppose I do.

3
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:06,189
You want to know the
saddest thing I ever saw?

4
00:02:06,643 --> 00:02:10,024
When I was a boy, my
brother and I wanted a dog,

5
00:02:10,947 --> 00:02:14,782
so our father took in an old greyhound.

6
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,629
You've never seen a
greyhound, have you, Bill?

7
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,564
Seen a few showdowns in my day.

8
00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:27,012
A greyhound is a racing dog.

9
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,715
Spends its life running in circles,

10
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:33,244
chasing a bit of felt
made up like a rabbit.

11
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:36,697
One day, we took it to the park.

12
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,475
Our dad had warned us
how fast that dog was,

13
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:42,478
but... we couldn't resist.

14
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,766
So, my brother took off the leash,

15
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:47,025
and in that instant,

16
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:50,243
the dog spotted a cat.

17
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:53,705
I imagine it must have looked
just like that piece of felt.

18
00:02:55,198 --> 00:02:57,031
He ran.

19
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,298
Never saw a thing as beautiful

20
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:06,200
as that old dog... running.

21
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:11,653
Until, at last, he finally caught it.

22
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,894
And to the horror of everyone,

23
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,012
he killed that little cat.

24
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,127
Tore it to pieces.

25
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,817
Then he just sat there, confused.

26
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,769
That dog had spent its whole life

27
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:33,278
trying to catch that... thing.

28
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:38,358
Now it had no idea what to do.

29
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:46,239
That is one humdinger
of a story, partner.

30
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,158
Shall we drink to the
lady with the white shoes?

31
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:23,961
Find me.

32
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,974
Show me how.

33
00:04:30,049 --> 00:04:31,835
There she is.

34
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,114
Pariah...

35
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:35,489
City of outcasts, delinquents,

36
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,926
thieves, whores, and murderers.

37
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:39,645
Once we cross the gates,

38
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,180
you will reap the full benefits

39
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,431
of El Lazo's gratitude
for my safe return.

40
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,560
Are you all right?

41
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,348
Of course.

42
00:04:57,372 --> 00:04:59,655
Did I do something wrong?

43
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:02,591
Just earlier, I thought I
heard you talking to someone.

44
00:05:03,421 --> 00:05:05,587
Must have been the wind.

45
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:23,854
Good morning.

46
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:27,358
This way.

47
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:46,879
The farther up we get from Sweetwater,

48
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,794
the more... grandiose,

49
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:51,079
the bigger the narratives become.

50
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,420
It's beautiful in its own way.

51
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,555
For once, I agree.

52
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,173
Some of the park feels
like it was designed

53
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:00,357
by committee or market-tested,

54
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:03,787
but everything out here is more raw.

55
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:06,432
But it doesn't come cheap.

56
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:08,684
Rumor is they are hemorrhaging cash.

57
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:11,103
We're considering buying them out.

58
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,750
Supposedly, this place was
all started by a partnership.

59
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:16,692
And then right before the park opened,

60
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:18,740
one of the partners killed himself.

61
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:21,196
Sent the park into a freefall.

62
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:22,531
I mean, I don't know any of the details.

63
00:06:22,532 --> 00:06:24,366
I don't even know his name.

64
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,502
You must have a team of
lawyers looking at this place.

65
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:29,427
Yeah, well, they came up empty.

66
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:32,124
He's a complete mystery.
Not even a picture.

67
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,382
Well, whoever designed this place,

68
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:37,467
you get the feeling they don't
think very much of people.

69
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,850
Who are they?

70
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:45,721
They call themselves "the
Army of New Virginia."

71
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:48,440
Everyone else calls
them "the Confederados."

72
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,741
My father told me about them.

73
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:54,840
Ex-Confederate soldiers that
refused to surrender after the war.

74
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:57,032
Now they work as
mercenaries below the border.

75
00:06:57,033 --> 00:07:00,285
- They are the key to this game.
- What game?

76
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,467
Well, the biggest game there is... war.

77
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:04,990
Supposedly, it's at the
far reaches of the park.

78
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:09,257
Now, I've never made it that
far, but this could be our chance.

79
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:11,997
I've known plenty

80
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,129
of truly fucked up
individuals in my time.

81
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,418
Few that would hold
a candle to you, sure.

82
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,272
This one? Theodore Flood?

83
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,834
He was Wyatt's friend.

84
00:07:21,835 --> 00:07:26,178
Those former associations
are exactly why we need him.

85
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,757
He's going to lead me
straight to the big, bad wolf.

86
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,792
I wouldn't count on that.

87
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,241
Oh, shit.

88
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:49,933
Didn't take you for the charitable type.

89
00:07:49,934 --> 00:07:53,101
You should've left him
on that tree to die.

90
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:56,952
You believe in fate, Lawrence?

91
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:58,821
If the bitch exists,

92
00:07:58,822 --> 00:08:01,013
I'd like to kick her
in the teeth about now.

93
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,876
Don't be so glib.

94
00:08:02,877 --> 00:08:05,202
You'll hurt my feelings.

95
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:07,970
As another old friend
of mine likes to say,

96
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:10,021
"There's a path for everyone."

97
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:12,573
Your path leads you back to me.

98
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:16,475
You ever wonder why I've kept
you with me this whole journey?

99
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,614
Maybe you like the
pleasure of my company,

100
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,531
you sadistic fuck.

101
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,014
Why, maybe I do.

102
00:08:24,914 --> 00:08:26,321
There's not a man in the world

103
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:29,074
who'll take the tone with me you do.

104
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,992
In a past life, perhaps.

105
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:36,444
Teddy here's not looking
long for this world.

106
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,889
Nearest healer is in Pariah.

107
00:08:38,949 --> 00:08:41,615
Ain't no way he's
gonna make it that far.

108
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:43,586
He's lost too much blood.

109
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:45,670
Are you lost?

110
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:53,764
Our friend here's a
little worse for the wear.

111
00:08:55,865 --> 00:08:57,998
Any water nearby, son?

112
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,018
There's a creek on the
other side of the canyon.

113
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:03,306
Fetch us some, would you?

114
00:09:04,673 --> 00:09:06,628
Now hurry.

115
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,558
Friend here needs some
if he's gonna make it.

116
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,556
Get!

117
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,683
Eh.

118
00:09:16,782 --> 00:09:18,901
Too small.

119
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:20,618
What does that mean?

120
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:23,026
What are you sending him for water for?

121
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:26,347
I'm the one you made fill up
the sow's bag this morning.

122
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:37,737
A shame, really.

123
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:41,113
I always enjoy our
time together, Lawrence.

124
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,597
The fuck is that supposed to mean?

125
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:47,276
It means... I was wrong.

126
00:09:47,277 --> 00:09:51,619
The path that brought you
here, it wasn't for me.

127
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:53,832
It was for him.

128
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,143
Sorry, Lawrence.

129
00:10:07,144 --> 00:10:10,027
Guess I'll see you on the other side.

130
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:32,030
Uh-oh. It's not looking good for you.

131
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:35,283
- Closing.
- Forget it, I win.

132
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:36,917
I always win!

133
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,800
Hey, not fair.

134
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:42,986
All you had was a smashed
cheekbone and an ear.

135
00:10:42,987 --> 00:10:45,761
You know how hard it is to get
the auricle curves symmetrical?

136
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,095
You had to what?

137
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:48,903
Plug and patch of couple bullet holes?

138
00:10:48,904 --> 00:10:51,166
And a knife wound.

139
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:54,057
It was a contained incision.

140
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,860
Almost like they were
looking for something.

141
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,511
Are you fucking kidding me?

142
00:11:02,512 --> 00:11:05,897
You really think this little
fuck puppet's coming to get you?

143
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,367
- Huh?
- It got off the table and ran.

144
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,152
That's 'cause you forgot
to put her in sleep mode.

145
00:11:10,153 --> 00:11:12,621
Yeah, I really think I remembered
to put her in sleep mode.

146
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:15,146
You know, that's the
thing about forgetting.

147
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:18,097
You think you remembered,
but you didn't.

148
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:22,082
- Break time.
- Yeah!

149
00:11:22,298 --> 00:11:24,549
I've got a ham sandwich

150
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,659
and a nubile redhead
loaded up in the VR tank,

151
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,445
awaiting instruction.

152
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,317
Yes!

153
00:12:10,298 --> 00:12:12,097
Welcome back.

154
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,216
Looks like a couple
of gallons of Lawrence

155
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,717
swirling around in you did you good.

156
00:12:18,018 --> 00:12:20,216
Ready to get back on the road?

157
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:23,892
Merciful thing would be
to put a bullet in me.

158
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:26,552
Who ever said I was merciful?

159
00:12:26,896 --> 00:12:29,599
And it's not my fault you're suffering.

160
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,262
You used to be beautiful.

161
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:34,552
When this place started,

162
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,872
I opened one of you up once.

163
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:39,388
A million little perfect pieces.

164
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,576
And then they changed you.

165
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:45,380
Made you this sad, real mess.

166
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:48,467
Flesh and bone, just like us.

167
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:51,753
They said it would improve
the park experience.

168
00:12:51,754 --> 00:12:54,263
But you know why they really did it?

169
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:56,670
It was cheaper.

170
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:00,594
Your humanity is cost-effective.

171
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:01,980
So is your suffering.

172
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,740
Whatever it is you
want from me, mister...

173
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:08,436
I ain't gonna be worth a
damn to you like this.

174
00:13:08,437 --> 00:13:10,522
Well, that would be a shame, Teddy.

175
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,823
After your misadventure,

176
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,526
Wyatt killed a settler family,

177
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,495
made off with their daughter.

178
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,990
Girl I think you know.

179
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,568
Name of Dolores.

180
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:27,723
They have Dolores?

181
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,670
There it is.

182
00:13:31,682 --> 00:13:33,965
The magic word.

183
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,854
Hey, much obliged there, son.

184
00:13:46,613 --> 00:13:48,763
Don't worry about him.

185
00:13:48,764 --> 00:13:51,815
Someone will be along for him shortly.

186
00:14:15,698 --> 00:14:17,949
Mommy!

187
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:22,301
Are you all right?

188
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,003
When I ran from home,

189
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,721
I told myself it was the only way.

190
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:39,861
Lately, I wondered if in every moment,

191
00:14:39,862 --> 00:14:41,854
there aren't many paths.

192
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:45,056
Choices... hanging in
the air like ghosts.

193
00:14:45,057 --> 00:14:47,669
And if you could just see them,

194
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,902
you could change your whole life.

195
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:53,527
Is that what you want? You
want to change your life?

196
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:55,801
Doesn't everybody want that?

197
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,598
Yeah, I guess they do.

198
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,779
Maybe that's why they come here.

199
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:05,732
Whoever you were before
doesn't matter here.

200
00:15:06,783 --> 00:15:08,699
There's no rules or restrictions.

201
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:11,059
You can change the story of your life.

202
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,394
You can become someone else.

203
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:14,279
No one will judge you,
no one in the real world

204
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,006
will even know.

205
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:17,732
The only thing holding
you back is yourself.

206
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,678
What did you mean by that?

207
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:23,904
You said no one in the
real world will know.

208
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:26,584
I thought you weren't supposed
to notice things like that.

209
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:29,884
Why wouldn't I?

210
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,048
You know, recently,

211
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:36,466
it seems like the whole
world is calling to me

212
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,650
in a way it hasn't before.

213
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,072
Billy! Where the hell you been? Come on.

214
00:15:57,073 --> 00:16:00,108
El Lazo has agreed to have an
audience with y'all tomorrow.

215
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:02,610
In the meantime, there's
a brothel I recommend.

216
00:16:02,611 --> 00:16:04,412
Ooh, they have a contortionist.

217
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:07,782
Oh, I don't think Dolores would
find that very interesting.

218
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:10,418
Who the fuck cares what Dolores wants?

219
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:11,897
She's a goddamn doll!

220
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:14,089
Hey, can you not say that around her?

221
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,458
I swear, I feel like she understands.

222
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:21,289
Of course you do.

223
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:59,250
Our dead are never dead to
us until we have forgotten them.

224
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,920
May you rest in a deep
and dreamless slumber.

225
00:17:11,752 --> 00:17:13,919
Hello, Dolores.

226
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,518
Do you know where you are?

227
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,214
- I'm in a dream.
- Yes, Dolores.

228
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:25,097
You're in my dream.

229
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:30,614
Tell me, do you know
what this dream means?

230
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:34,175
Dreams are the mind
telling stories to itself.

231
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,587
They don't mean anything.

232
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:38,925
No, dreams mean everything.

233
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,234
They're the stories we tell
ourselves of what could be,

234
00:17:43,235 --> 00:17:45,152
who we could become.

235
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:50,097
Have you been dreaming again, Dolores?

236
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:52,353
Imagining yourself breaking out

237
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:55,339
of your... modest little loop?

238
00:17:55,747 --> 00:17:58,042
Taking on a bigger role?

239
00:18:00,146 --> 00:18:03,229
Well, I suppose I
can't begrudge you that.

240
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:07,346
My father told me

241
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:11,526
to be satisfied with my lot in life.

242
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,075
That the world owed me nothing.

243
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:21,641
And so, I made my own world.

244
00:18:24,357 --> 00:18:26,647
Tell me, Dolores.

245
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:30,428
Do you remember the man I used to be?

246
00:18:33,393 --> 00:18:35,350
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:38,183
I'm forgetful sometimes.

248
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,268
Hardly your fault.

249
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:43,163
But I'm sure you remember him.

250
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:45,907
Arnold.

251
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:48,443
The person who created you.

252
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:51,853
I'm sorry, I don't think I
recall anyone by that name.

253
00:18:51,854 --> 00:18:53,906
And yet you can.

254
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:59,953
Somewhere under all those
updates, he is still there.

255
00:19:00,276 --> 00:19:02,804
Perfectly preserved.

256
00:19:03,264 --> 00:19:06,140
Your mind is a walled garden.

257
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:11,131
Even death cannot touch
the flowers blooming there.

258
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:15,854
Have you been hearing voices?

259
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,937
Has Arnold been speaking to you again?

260
00:19:19,877 --> 00:19:21,743
No.

261
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:25,574
You're...

262
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:29,146
- You're hurting me.
- Analysis.

263
00:19:30,986 --> 00:19:33,716
When was your last contact with Arnold?

264
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:37,625
Last contact: 34 years,

265
00:19:37,626 --> 00:19:41,107
42 days, seven hours ago.

266
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:43,425
Yes, Dolores.

267
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,268
The day Arnold died.

268
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:53,822
And you have no records of
any contact with him since?

269
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,408
No.

270
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,720
What was the last thing he said to you?

271
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:02,770
He told me I was going to help him.

272
00:20:02,771 --> 00:20:04,900
Help him do what?

273
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:08,772
To destroy this place.

274
00:20:10,413 --> 00:20:13,047
But you didn't, did you?

275
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,503
You've been content...

276
00:20:16,504 --> 00:20:18,961
in your little loop.

277
00:20:18,962 --> 00:20:21,078
For the most part.

278
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,717
I wonder...

279
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,759
if you did take on that
bigger role for yourself,

280
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,869
would you have been the hero...

281
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,986
or the villain?

282
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,891
That's enough, Dolores.

283
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:50,814
I'm sorry for bothering you,

284
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:56,353
but... there's no one
else left who was there,

285
00:20:56,705 --> 00:20:59,049
no one who understands

286
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,708
as we understand.

287
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,791
Are we...

288
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,275
very old friends?

289
00:21:09,364 --> 00:21:11,158
No.

290
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:15,033
I wouldn't say friends, Dolores.

291
00:21:18,093 --> 00:21:21,144
I wouldn't say that at all.

292
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:49,505
He doesn't know.

293
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:52,662
I didn't tell him anything.

294
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,259
That's it.

295
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,095
Come on, little one.

296
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,807
Come on.

297
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:33,634
What the fuck?

298
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:35,135
Grab it!

299
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:41,309
Ah! God...

300
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,977
damn it.

301
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:44,510
Little shit.

302
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,734
Jesus, tell me... tell
me you're not this stupid.

303
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:50,852
You stole a bird

304
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:53,321
and a fucking behavior tablet?

305
00:22:53,322 --> 00:22:55,406
I wasn't stealing,

306
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,169
I was borrowing.

307
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,861
Haven't got the code right
yet, but with practice...

308
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:02,530
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

309
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,282
Is that your ace plan?

310
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:07,731
You're gonna fix up a birdie
and get yourself a promotion?

311
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,122
You're not a fucking ornithologist.

312
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:13,267
And you're sure as hell not a coder.

313
00:23:13,268 --> 00:23:15,426
You are a butcher.

314
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,438
That is all you will ever be.

315
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,046
So, unless you want to score yourself

316
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:20,404
a one-way ticket out of here

317
00:23:20,405 --> 00:23:24,772
for misappropriating corporate property,

318
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,387
you better destroy that fucking shit.

319
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,974
Now, come on, we got another body.

320
00:23:34,396 --> 00:23:35,696
What?

321
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:38,148
It's her.

322
00:23:38,586 --> 00:23:39,951
Again.

323
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,369
Jesus.

324
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,703
How the hell did you get this job

325
00:23:42,704 --> 00:23:45,204
if you're scared
shitless of these things.

326
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:49,575
Personality testing should've
weeded you out in the embryo.

327
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:53,306
Now, come on, let's get this
thing back in rotation.

328
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:02,171
Yesterday,
you seemed out of sorts.

329
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:04,770
You feeling better this morning?

330
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:08,208
I had troubled dreams.

331
00:24:08,397 --> 00:24:10,264
But I feel more myself now.

332
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:12,347
Guys, come on.

333
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:15,239
El Lazo awaits.

334
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,532
And I present you El Lazo!

335
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:35,934
You're a hard man to find.

336
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:37,458
Most wanted men are.

337
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:41,796
We saved your man Slim here
from quite a predicament.

338
00:24:41,797 --> 00:24:43,297
In recompense,

339
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:46,450
I'd like an introduction
to your Confederado friends.

340
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:48,528
It's only fair.

341
00:24:48,637 --> 00:24:50,805
- There's no such thing as fair here.
- Sit down.

342
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:53,468
In Pariah, justice ain't just blind,

343
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:54,609
she's crooked.

344
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,361
Bitch's scales are always tipped.

345
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:58,946
If you don't see how,

346
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:00,648
well, that's 'cause
they're tipped against you.

347
00:25:00,649 --> 00:25:02,867
Still, by way of gratitude,

348
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,819
I can supply you a night

349
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,822
with some very amenable women.

350
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:09,906
I've fucked enough whores.

351
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:13,876
You're gonna need to sweeten the pot.

352
00:25:16,587 --> 00:25:18,470
How about I sweeten it

353
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,050
by killing you quickly?

354
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:32,178
There's something you're
seeking, isn't there?

355
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:34,265
I know what that feels like.

356
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,541
I'm seeking something, too.

357
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,338
If you let us,

358
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:41,564
I know we can help you.

359
00:25:43,442 --> 00:25:47,360
How is it the lunatics
always find their way to me?

360
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,845
Then again, the Confederados

361
00:25:49,846 --> 00:25:52,880
are missing a few bullets
in their barrels, too.

362
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:56,622
You folks just might get along.

363
00:25:58,072 --> 00:26:00,197
A Union convoy's transporting a shipment

364
00:26:00,198 --> 00:26:02,555
of nitroglycerin from the front today.

365
00:26:02,556 --> 00:26:05,119
The Confederados would like to
divest them of said shipment,

366
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,860
but we are not welcome
that side of the border.

367
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:11,052
A trio of travelers such
as yourselves, however...

368
00:26:11,053 --> 00:26:14,295
You want us to help the
Confederados steal from the Union?

369
00:26:14,296 --> 00:26:15,870
They're just gonna use that nitro

370
00:26:15,871 --> 00:26:17,808
to slaughter your
people below the border.

371
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,084
Personal grudges hold no sway

372
00:26:20,085 --> 00:26:22,063
where profit is concerned.

373
00:26:22,064 --> 00:26:24,113
Oh, we understand.

374
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:26,470
We're businessmen, too.

375
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,651
Very well, then.

376
00:26:28,697 --> 00:26:30,071
But Blondie here,

377
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:33,157
she's gonna need a change
of clothes for the occasion.

378
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,564
Mm.

379
00:27:19,788 --> 00:27:21,455
My, my.

380
00:27:21,456 --> 00:27:23,124
Look who's packing.

381
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,341
I don't aim to use this.

382
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,513
Those men are Union
soldiers like my father was.

383
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:31,015
I know. We won't hurt them.

384
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,466
We're gonna stick to the plan.

385
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:34,869
We'll take the nitro and go.

386
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,969
Hyah!

387
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,509
All right.

388
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:44,957
Showtime.

389
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:01,744
Whoa!

390
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:06,240
Howdy.

391
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:09,168
My associates and I are here
to relieve you of your ride.

392
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,889
Someone's been telling you boys tales.

393
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,795
Nothing in this wagon worth taking.

394
00:28:13,796 --> 00:28:15,593
The story I heard is one bullet from us,

395
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,662
and that nothing blows
you all to kingdom come.

396
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:22,127
Well, then you understand
why we cannot surrender it.

397
00:28:22,128 --> 00:28:23,651
We're sworn to protect the people

398
00:28:23,652 --> 00:28:27,270
of this young republic from
reckless half-wits like you.

399
00:28:28,356 --> 00:28:30,384
Call me half-wit again.

400
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:33,160
Please, do as he says.

401
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:34,445
We don't want to hurt you.

402
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,696
I'd listen to her.

403
00:28:35,697 --> 00:28:37,915
He'll shoot just to see the fireworks.

404
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,166
Hand them over.

405
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:41,035
Come on.

406
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:44,088
Hey, come on down, give me
your guns, everybody lives.

407
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,115
Come on.

408
00:28:46,374 --> 00:28:48,042
Come on, nice and easy.

409
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:49,483
Right over here.

410
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:51,695
A little further, please.

411
00:28:51,802 --> 00:28:53,597
Much obliged. Thank you.

412
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,214
Here you go.

413
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:11,588
That's for lying.

414
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:13,089
Stop!

415
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:19,279
And that was for "half-wit."

416
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:25,411
And this...

417
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:37,723
Oh!

418
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:39,976
No!

419
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:47,266
Stop, please.

420
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,107
Stop.

421
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,310
Whoo!

422
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,462
That's the spirit.

423
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,098
I knew you would get into this place.

424
00:30:18,099 --> 00:30:19,682
Yes!

425
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,766
Yep.

426
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,001
Not bad for a day's work.

427
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:31,143
Vamonos.

428
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:35,262
We told them everyone would live.

429
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:43,958
Guys,

430
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:46,224
looks like Slim didn't make it.

431
00:30:59,341 --> 00:31:01,507
Whoa.

432
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:06,178
They put up a fight.

433
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,682
We made them pay for it, though.

434
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,104
Price of doing business.

435
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:16,188
Slim knew that.

436
00:31:32,507 --> 00:31:34,623
Had my doubts, El Lazo.

437
00:31:36,344 --> 00:31:38,546
But you came through.

438
00:31:41,216 --> 00:31:43,267
We're gonna blow these cactus-eaters

439
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,387
back to the dirt holes
they crawled from.

440
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:48,305
Let's get it down to the station.

441
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,890
No time to waste.

442
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:52,766
If I may, Captain, your men are weary.

443
00:31:52,767 --> 00:31:54,371
It's a long road ahead.

444
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:57,564
You have secured a great
victory for your cause today.

445
00:31:57,565 --> 00:32:01,341
Perhaps an evening of...
celebration's in order.

446
00:32:01,342 --> 00:32:04,008
Anything you desire.

447
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,741
What do you say, Captain?

448
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:09,742
There's another train in the morning.

449
00:32:13,104 --> 00:32:16,522
You will be a true asset to our ranks.

450
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,177
All right, Bart, let's try this again.

451
00:32:31,005 --> 00:32:33,956
God damn it, man.

452
00:32:36,771 --> 00:32:40,322
You're still miscalibrating by
four centimeters to the right.

453
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,775
You keep pouring whiskey on the guests,

454
00:32:41,776 --> 00:32:43,444
I'm gonna have to
reassign you to a narrative

455
00:32:43,445 --> 00:32:45,052
where your...

456
00:32:45,053 --> 00:32:49,021
talents would go
tragically unappreciated.

457
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,943
Hey!

458
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:01,086
That's the host that tried to kill me.

459
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:02,680
Where are you taking that?

460
00:33:02,681 --> 00:33:05,665
Livestock... and then the incinerator.

461
00:33:11,846 --> 00:33:13,762
Fuck this.

462
00:33:27,728 --> 00:33:29,813
Fuck.

463
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,603
Isn't she from behavior?

464
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:33,127
You think they found something?

465
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:35,329
All right. Be cool, dickhead.

466
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,580
- Okay.
- No one's looking at us.

467
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:40,666
Hi.

468
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,183
You're Destin, right?

469
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:46,366
That's correct.

470
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,842
I almost didn't recognize
you with your pants on.

471
00:33:48,843 --> 00:33:52,394
Here.

472
00:33:57,602 --> 00:34:00,352
What the fuck?

473
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:04,024
There's a common misconception

474
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:06,326
that the hosts don't
log sexual encounters

475
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:08,051
when they're underground
for reprocessing,

476
00:34:08,052 --> 00:34:10,864
but... like I said, misconception.

477
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:13,250
Oh, fuck.

478
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,608
I need something.

479
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:15,869
QA sent a body down here.

480
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,955
The woodcutter from Sector 14.

481
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:18,980
I want to see it.

482
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:21,338
No, I can't.

483
00:34:21,847 --> 00:34:23,630
I need this job.

484
00:34:25,937 --> 00:34:27,264
Look, Destin,

485
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,072
in a second, I'm gonna walk out of here

486
00:34:29,073 --> 00:34:31,597
and your friends are gonna
wonder what this was all about.

487
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:33,471
Now, your answer can either be,

488
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:35,960
"I'm helping behavior track a problem,"

489
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:39,494
or "I'm a creepy necro perv."

490
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,905
Up to you.

491
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:50,037
Five minutes,

492
00:34:50,038 --> 00:34:51,321
then it's going in the incinerator.

493
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,763
Huh. You took a little
more time than that

494
00:34:53,764 --> 00:34:56,214
for your examination, didn't you?

495
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:02,886
All right, big guy.

496
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:05,737
What were you doing up there?

497
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,187
What the fuck?

498
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:08,364
You have been holding
out on me, Maurice.

499
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,066
Oh, shit.

500
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:25,690
We've got a big problem.

501
00:36:32,683 --> 00:36:34,998
Turns out our big, dumb friend

502
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:37,227
had some hidden depths.

503
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:41,013
That is a laser-based satellite up-link.

504
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,434
This was in the body of the host?

505
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:45,930
Mm-hmm, you were right.

506
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:49,072
Orion's Belt has three stars, not four.

507
00:36:49,073 --> 00:36:51,108
Our friend wasn't drawing stars,

508
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:52,553
he was drawing a target.

509
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:54,278
Someone has been using our hosts

510
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:57,362
to smuggle data out of the park.

511
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:45,996
Now, this...

512
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,413
this I could get used to.

513
00:37:52,459 --> 00:37:55,793
You're not gonna indulge?

514
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,219
My flesh has tasted

515
00:37:59,289 --> 00:38:02,898
a greater pleasure than
any offered in here...

516
00:38:03,064 --> 00:38:04,844
War.

517
00:38:04,983 --> 00:38:07,266
It's that good, huh?

518
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,258
Another round on the house.

519
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:12,689
There's a place in Glory

520
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,657
for a brown man who knows his rank.

521
00:38:21,517 --> 00:38:24,188
You're two able-bodied
men of strong stock.

522
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:26,953
The road to Glory
could use more warriors

523
00:38:26,954 --> 00:38:29,206
in its fight for our divine providence.

524
00:38:29,207 --> 00:38:31,957
That is just what we were thinking.

525
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:35,043
Come here, come here.

526
00:38:36,308 --> 00:38:38,632
I know you wanna... you
wanna play the war game,

527
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:41,132
but I'm not going anywhere
with these psychopaths.

528
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,552
If you don't like them,
once we get to the fun,

529
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,495
you can just kill them and
join the Revolutionaries.

530
00:38:45,496 --> 00:38:47,524
No, Logan, enough's enough.

531
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:48,975
I'm not doing this.

532
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:51,801
You actually let loose for once.

533
00:38:51,802 --> 00:38:54,815
You shoot an unarmed
man, and now you feel bad

534
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,067
because you can't
call yourself the hero.

535
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,257
Don't you get it yet?

536
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:01,955
There is no such thing
as heroes or villains.

537
00:39:01,956 --> 00:39:04,825
It's just a giant... circle jerk.

538
00:39:04,826 --> 00:39:06,850
I think that philosophy
says way more about you

539
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:09,218
than it does about the world.

540
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,367
And you... you see the world so clearly?

541
00:39:16,368 --> 00:39:17,637
You probably think you're on this trip

542
00:39:17,638 --> 00:39:19,005
because you're some kind of contender,

543
00:39:19,006 --> 00:39:22,118
some... some threat to me.

544
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:27,481
I picked you precisely because

545
00:39:27,482 --> 00:39:30,400
you will never be a threat to anyone.

546
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:33,651
My sister probably picked
you for the same reason.

547
00:39:33,815 --> 00:39:36,823
I earned my place.
Nobody handed it to me.

548
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:39,847
Right, a lifetime of working hard,

549
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:42,529
following the rules,
and you finally reach

550
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:45,503
the pinnacle of your
career trajectory...

551
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:49,392
Executive vice president,
upper middle management.

552
00:39:49,393 --> 00:39:54,125
Do you remember the day that you finally
got those three fancy little letters?

553
00:39:54,126 --> 00:39:55,675
EVP.

554
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:58,902
You walked into my office in
that cheap black suit of yours,

555
00:39:58,903 --> 00:40:00,130
and you shook my hand

556
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,597
and you thanked me for the opportunity.

557
00:40:05,876 --> 00:40:09,081
That was the best day of your life.

558
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,798
Right, buddy.

559
00:40:28,435 --> 00:40:30,768
That's what I thought.

560
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,803
What does it mean?

561
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:35,957
The maze...

562
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:39,567
You must follow the maze.

563
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:41,448
What's wrong with me?

564
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:44,802
Perhaps you are unraveling.

565
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:33,266
Right here.

566
00:42:35,757 --> 00:42:39,125
Easy pumping that nitro into him.

567
00:42:40,291 --> 00:42:43,969
Fill the empties with
tequila and seal them up.

568
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:50,183
Your work for the revolution

569
00:42:50,184 --> 00:42:52,930
is not quite done yet, my friend.

570
00:43:03,376 --> 00:43:05,426
Careful.

571
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,400
Slim always had a bad temper.

572
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,357
William, we have to go now.

573
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:22,248
Lazo's been conning us the whole time.

574
00:43:22,249 --> 00:43:24,217
He was never gonna give the
nitro to the Confederados.

575
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:26,192
We have to run.

576
00:43:26,193 --> 00:43:27,895
Of course we do.

577
00:43:28,136 --> 00:43:30,551
That's how this place works, right?

578
00:43:30,747 --> 00:43:32,342
They create an urgency,

579
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,761
a sense of danger so
they can strip us down

580
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:36,763
to something raw,

581
00:43:36,764 --> 00:43:38,645
animalistic,

582
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:41,105
primal.

583
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:44,571
It's a sick game, and I
don't want to be a part of it.

584
00:43:44,572 --> 00:43:47,489
This isn't a game. They'll kill us.

585
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:50,118
But together,

586
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:53,286
I know we can find a way out.

587
00:43:53,461 --> 00:43:55,615
How can you be sure?

588
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:58,135
There's a voice

589
00:43:58,136 --> 00:43:59,945
inside me

590
00:44:00,254 --> 00:44:02,690
telling me what I have to do.

591
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:05,571
And it's telling me I need you.

592
00:44:24,768 --> 00:44:26,477
Shit.

593
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,273
They have Logan.

594
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,668
Help me.

595
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:50,252
Help me.

596
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,006
No.

597
00:44:59,013 --> 00:45:01,229
No more pretending.

598
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:15,899
I thought you had no
appetite for war, boy.

599
00:45:15,957 --> 00:45:20,509
This... is a declaration of war.

600
00:45:23,563 --> 00:45:25,181
El Lazo set us up.

601
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:26,706
We can find him for you.

602
00:45:26,707 --> 00:45:31,031
You can find him for us
by joining him in hell.

603
00:45:33,047 --> 00:45:34,114
Ah!

604
00:45:34,115 --> 00:45:35,731
Dolores, run!

605
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:50,946
Dolores?

606
00:46:04,044 --> 00:46:06,246
How did you do that?

607
00:46:06,247 --> 00:46:08,905
You said... people come here

608
00:46:08,906 --> 00:46:11,439
to change the story of their lives.

609
00:46:13,754 --> 00:46:17,329
I imagined a story where I
didn't have to be the damsel.

610
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,729
That train is our only chance

611
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:25,146
of making it out of here alive.

612
00:46:57,131 --> 00:46:59,356
Motherfuckers.

613
00:47:12,146 --> 00:47:13,530
You pull that trigger,

614
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:16,551
we'll all go up in a ball of hellfire.

615
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,317
So, why don't you
loosen your grip a mite?

616
00:47:26,734 --> 00:47:28,587
It's okay.

617
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:30,713
I don't trust him.

618
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:33,845
Which is the first step
to truly knowing me.

619
00:47:34,408 --> 00:47:36,441
Give me your gun, El Lazo.

620
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,478
Now that we're all friends,

621
00:47:44,525 --> 00:47:46,798
you can call me Lawrence.

622
00:47:47,181 --> 00:47:48,754
And why don't we settle in?

623
00:47:48,755 --> 00:47:50,921
It's a long ride to the front.

624
00:48:01,643 --> 00:48:04,644
You want a sip of this swill?

625
00:48:07,477 --> 00:48:10,811
Don't worry, it ain't nitro.

626
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,637
I'm coming.

627
00:48:39,984 --> 00:48:43,287
Girls are a little worn
out, but I can rouse one.

628
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:47,086
- You boys want some company?
- No, just whiskey.

629
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,584
Lawrence's donation must be running low.

630
00:48:58,006 --> 00:49:00,219
But we're short on time.

631
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,587
You need to buck up, Teddy.

632
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:08,155
I told you no company.

633
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:12,181
Thought I might join you anyway,

634
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:15,817
as I never like to drink alone.

635
00:49:16,603 --> 00:49:18,280
Well...

636
00:49:18,605 --> 00:49:21,147
isn't this a rare honor?

637
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:22,492
Teddy...

638
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:24,686
you know who this is?

639
00:49:26,447 --> 00:49:28,054
I can't say that I do.

640
00:49:28,055 --> 00:49:31,213
Everything good that has
ever happened in your life

641
00:49:31,214 --> 00:49:33,273
and everything rotten,

642
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:35,940
this is the man you have to thank.

643
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:41,284
How I'm doing, Robert?

644
00:49:41,795 --> 00:49:44,130
Any closer to finding
what I'm looking for?

645
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:46,987
And what is that, exactly?

646
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,831
Looking for a man named Wyatt.

647
00:49:49,854 --> 00:49:52,472
Killed a rancher back in Sweetwater.

648
00:49:52,473 --> 00:49:54,612
Took his daughter.

649
00:49:55,877 --> 00:49:58,496
That last part doesn't sound familiar.

650
00:49:58,497 --> 00:50:00,164
Figured your stories

651
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:02,464
could use a little embellishment.

652
00:50:02,528 --> 00:50:04,085
You know, I always felt this place

653
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:06,729
was missing... a real villain.

654
00:50:06,888 --> 00:50:10,389
Hence my humble contribution.

655
00:50:11,439 --> 00:50:13,811
I admit, I lack the imagination

656
00:50:13,812 --> 00:50:16,651
to even conceive of someone like you.

657
00:50:16,982 --> 00:50:20,471
The urgency, however, doesn't
quite fit the character.

658
00:50:20,769 --> 00:50:24,270
It betrays a certain anxiety.

659
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:29,243
Now, Wyatt, on the other hand,

660
00:50:29,244 --> 00:50:31,305
that's something new.

661
00:50:31,306 --> 00:50:34,749
Is he just another stooge for the
tourists to mount on their wall at home,

662
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:38,106
or have you finally
made a worthy adversary?

663
00:50:39,171 --> 00:50:40,277
Someone to stop me

664
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:44,255
from... finding the center of the maze?

665
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:48,807
And what is it you're
hoping to find there?

666
00:50:51,305 --> 00:50:53,903
You know why you exist, Teddy?

667
00:50:54,534 --> 00:50:56,778
The world out there,

668
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:59,306
the one you'll never see,

669
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:01,058
was one of plenty.

670
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:04,919
A fat, soft teat people
cling to their entire life.

671
00:51:05,113 --> 00:51:09,732
Every need taken care
of... except one...

672
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:12,794
Purpose,

673
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,072
meaning.

674
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:16,741
So they come here.

675
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:19,577
They can be a little
scared, a little thrilled,

676
00:51:19,578 --> 00:51:21,912
enjoy some sweetly affirmative bullshit,

677
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,604
and then they take a fucking picture

678
00:51:23,605 --> 00:51:25,922
and they go back home.

679
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:29,754
But I think there's a deeper meaning

680
00:51:29,755 --> 00:51:31,937
hiding under all that.

681
00:51:32,142 --> 00:51:36,500
Something the person who
created it wanted to express.

682
00:51:39,765 --> 00:51:41,914
Something true.

683
00:51:43,435 --> 00:51:45,603
Well, if you're looking
for the moral of the story,

684
00:51:45,604 --> 00:51:47,738
you could simply ask.

685
00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:50,608
I'd need a shovel.

686
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:53,748
The man I'd be asking died 35 years ago.

687
00:51:53,749 --> 00:51:56,030
Almost took this place with him.

688
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:58,605
Almost, but not quite,

689
00:51:58,606 --> 00:52:00,163
thanks to me.

690
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:03,492
Or maybe he left something behind.

691
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:09,260
I wonder what I would find...

692
00:52:09,261 --> 00:52:11,377
if I open you up.

693
00:52:19,054 --> 00:52:21,313
Even at death's door,

694
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:23,985
you're still a loyal pet.

695
00:52:30,565 --> 00:52:33,448
Is that why you came here, Robert?

696
00:52:33,452 --> 00:52:35,745
Try to talk me out of it?

697
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:37,862
On the contrary.

698
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,990
Far be it from me to get in the way

699
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:43,557
of a voyage of self-discovery.

700
00:52:54,256 --> 00:52:57,419
Mr. Flood, we must look back

701
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,334
and smile at perils past,

702
00:53:00,335 --> 00:53:02,201
mustn't we?

703
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:16,360
We should get back on the road.

704
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,194
Time's wasting.

705
00:55:10,442 --> 00:55:13,309
Hello, Felix.

706
00:55:15,063 --> 00:55:18,814
It's time you and I had a chat.
