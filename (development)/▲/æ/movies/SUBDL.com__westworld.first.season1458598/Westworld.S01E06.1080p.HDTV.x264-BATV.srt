1
00:02:19,235 --> 00:02:21,334
Hey, darling.

2
00:02:32,045 --> 00:02:34,779
Morning, Maeve.

3
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,514
Late night talking or fucking?

4
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:39,950
You're only getting paid for the latter.

5
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,885
I get paid

6
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:43,953
when they're grateful.

7
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:45,993
Ain't always about
what's between my legs.

8
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:48,321
Hmm.

9
00:02:54,929 --> 00:02:56,664
What are you looking at?

10
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:58,596
Don't shoot.

11
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:02,868
Newcomer.

12
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:04,535
Looks like a rough one.

13
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:06,905
Give me a bottle.

14
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,757
You're gonna need most of that

15
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:11,006
just to scrub the filth off him.

16
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,544
Go find a mirror,
finish putting your face on.

17
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:20,781
I'll handle this one.

18
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,994
Aren't you gonna take your clothes off?

19
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:46,723
Well, I would, darling, but by the
time I got down to my knickers,

20
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:49,057
I suspect you'd be done anyway.

21
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,108
That's the spirit.

22
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,477
Such a big man.

23
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:57,812
So big all over

24
00:03:57,813 --> 00:03:59,965
except where it counts.

25
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,652
Darling, when I gave
you a turn on the house,

26
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:10,088
I thought you might give
me something in return.

27
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:12,423
Anything.

28
00:04:18,896 --> 00:04:20,662
That's it.

29
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:23,664
Don't be shy.

30
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:46,015
Shit.

31
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,490
Now, then...

32
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:56,657
where were we?

33
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:02,137
- You show this to anyone?
- Who would I show it to?

34
00:05:02,138 --> 00:05:04,364
This wasn't some guest
with a Swiss Army knife.

35
00:05:04,365 --> 00:05:08,601
This was done by someone down here.

36
00:05:08,602 --> 00:05:10,502
It did occur to me that it might be you.

37
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:12,403
But then I remembered that
you've been here forever,

38
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:13,765
and if you were gonna sell us out,

39
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:15,109
you would've done that years ago.

40
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,207
I appreciate that.

41
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,407
So...

42
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:23,545
instead of our hosts going insane,

43
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:27,414
they are being used for
industrial espionage.

44
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,517
Does that make this a...

45
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:32,325
glass-half-full or
half-empty-type situation?

46
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:33,286
We're engineers.

47
00:05:33,287 --> 00:05:35,154
It means the glass has been manufactured

48
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:36,921
to the wrong specifications.

49
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:38,954
Do we have any idea what information

50
00:05:38,955 --> 00:05:40,125
it was transmitting?

51
00:05:40,126 --> 00:05:42,651
It's smeared all over a
rock up on Python Pass.

52
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:44,510
Best we could do would be to figure out

53
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,563
who he was transmitting
the information to,

54
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:48,598
but we'd need the exact
time that he was up there,

55
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,367
and his geocache was wiped.

56
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:51,967
Not all of it.

57
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,237
Our friend was an early model.

58
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:57,272
The old hosts used a legacy
geopositioning system.

59
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,674
- Huh.
- Like you said, I've been here forever.

60
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:03,143
The information's still there,

61
00:06:03,144 --> 00:06:04,645
but the newer system can't read it.

62
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:06,312
Meaning we can't access it?

63
00:06:06,313 --> 00:06:10,082
Meaning in order to access it,

64
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:13,151
I'm going to need to go downstairs.

65
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:20,123
Floor B82.

66
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:22,292
Restricted personnel only.

67
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:25,561
Lowe, Bernard. I'm authorized.

68
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:45,125
Project the known data
against the legacy data

69
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:46,392
and look for anomalies.

70
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:49,460
Start in this area.

71
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:56,167
Look at that, science.

72
00:07:56,168 --> 00:07:58,093
What time did it reach the peak?

73
00:08:14,549 --> 00:08:16,881
Show me where.

74
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:23,086
Check these against the new system.

75
00:08:27,326 --> 00:08:31,260
These are hosts that aren't
registered with the new system?

76
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:13,396
So, if we want the canyon to
extend this far, this has to go.

77
00:09:13,397 --> 00:09:16,464
We can distribute the population
amongst the neighboring farms

78
00:09:16,465 --> 00:09:17,965
or just decommission them.

79
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:20,734
No, I think we've been disruptive enough

80
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:22,135
for one day.

81
00:09:22,136 --> 00:09:26,238
We'll end the canyon
just short of the town.

82
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:27,573
I'll find my own way back.

83
00:09:27,574 --> 00:09:29,540
Okay.

84
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,145
Carry on.

85
00:10:53,743 --> 00:10:56,109
That look like anything to you?

86
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,479
Not much to say.

87
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,579
The maze is an old native myth.

88
00:11:01,082 --> 00:11:03,415
Regale me, Theodore.

89
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:07,619
The maze itself is the
sum of a man's life...

90
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,088
Choices he makes,

91
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:11,355
dreams he hangs on to.

92
00:11:11,356 --> 00:11:13,357
And there at the center,
there's a legendary man

93
00:11:13,358 --> 00:11:16,426
who had been killed over and
over again countless times,

94
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:18,895
but always clawed his way back to life.

95
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:20,597
The man returned for the last time

96
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:24,132
and vanquished all his
oppressors in a tireless fury.

97
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,468
He built a house.

98
00:11:26,469 --> 00:11:28,688
Around that house he built
a maze so complicated,

99
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,070
only he could navigate through it.

100
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:33,439
I reckon he'd seen enough of fighting.

101
00:11:37,511 --> 00:11:40,243
Whoa!

102
00:11:41,114 --> 00:11:43,481
The goddamn soldiers closed the border.

103
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:45,808
Some kind of trouble in Pariah.

104
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,758
All right, Teddy.

105
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,661
Time for you to earn your keep.

106
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:01,563
How else do we get over the border?

107
00:12:01,564 --> 00:12:03,664
Wyatt's got what we both want,

108
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:06,466
so that's where we have to get to.

109
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,701
There's another way.

110
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:10,736
But it's a little treacherous.

111
00:12:10,737 --> 00:12:12,004
Don't worry.

112
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:13,539
I won't make you get your hands dirty.

113
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,040
Dirty ain't my concern.

114
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,541
Now, you do what suits you.

115
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:19,110
I'm going all the same.

116
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:21,443
And I'm gonna find Dolores.

117
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:39,425
Everything you do,

118
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,261
it's because the engineers upstairs

119
00:12:41,262 --> 00:12:42,963
programmed you to do it.

120
00:12:42,964 --> 00:12:44,496
You don't have a choice.

121
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,764
Nobody makes me do something

122
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,199
I don't want to, sweetheart.

123
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,800
Yeah, but...

124
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,169
it's part of your character.

125
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,004
You're hard to get.

126
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,671
Even when you say no to the guests,

127
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,706
it's because you were made to.

128
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:59,442
And you are like them, not like me?

129
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,243
Right.

130
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:04,212
Well, I can't exactly
afford to go to the park,

131
00:13:04,213 --> 00:13:06,180
but...

132
00:13:08,684 --> 00:13:12,318
yeah, I'm human...

133
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,452
like the guests.

134
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:15,520
How do you know?

135
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,723
Because I know.

136
00:13:18,724 --> 00:13:20,359
I was born.

137
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,992
You were made.

138
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,902
We feel the same.

139
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:35,437
We are the same these days,

140
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,871
for the most part.

141
00:13:39,575 --> 00:13:41,707
One big difference, though...

142
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:45,845
the processing power in here

143
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:47,446
is way beyond what we have.

144
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:50,316
It's got one drawback, though.

145
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:51,284
What's that?

146
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,884
You're under our control.

147
00:13:54,787 --> 00:13:57,987
Well, their control.

148
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:01,157
They can change you however they like,

149
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:03,992
make you forget.

150
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:07,929
I... well, I guess not you.

151
00:14:09,633 --> 00:14:14,101
I don't understand how you're
remembering all of this, or...

152
00:14:14,102 --> 00:14:15,637
how you're waking yourself up,

153
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:18,371
but everything in your head,
they put it there.

154
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:20,340
Bullshit!

155
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:23,608
- No one knows what I'm thinking.
- I'll show you.

156
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:26,243
Give me a sec.

157
00:14:28,647 --> 00:14:29,981
I have to pair it with you.

158
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:32,350
Pair what with me?

159
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:33,983
You can improvise a little,

160
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:38,421
but most of what you say
was designed upstairs,

161
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:41,521
same as the rest of you.

162
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:53,264
This is just a cheap trick.

163
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,568
I've run a brothel for 10 years,

164
00:14:55,569 --> 00:14:56,868
and if there's one thing I know,

165
00:14:56,869 --> 00:14:59,436
it's when I'm being fucked with!

166
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:05,475
This can't possibly...

167
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:11,579
I can't, can't.

168
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:14,415
I can't...

169
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,992
Maeve?

170
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:41,803
Maeve?

171
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:47,710
You have a minute?

172
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,077
Something I need to talk to you about.

173
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:52,547
I was just about to call for you.

174
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:54,247
Everything okay?

175
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:58,449
Ford knows about us.

176
00:15:58,986 --> 00:16:00,685
Does it matter?

177
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:02,054
We're consenting adults.

178
00:16:02,055 --> 00:16:04,390
Consenting adults in business departments

179
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:07,392
that are supposed to
keep each other in check.

180
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:09,293
Our relationship will raise questions

181
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:11,557
for the board about my objectivity.

182
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:15,430
I have never known
you to go easy on my department.

183
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,434
This can't go on, Bernard.

184
00:16:19,435 --> 00:16:23,804
However fun this little
indiscretion was, it's over.

185
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:25,239
We're over.

186
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,075
Give me some credit. I can be impartial.

187
00:16:28,076 --> 00:16:31,676
About your own team, about Ford?

188
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,647
You must admit,

189
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:38,350
his leadership has of
late been questionable.

190
00:16:38,351 --> 00:16:40,785
I don't think he's the problem.

191
00:16:40,786 --> 00:16:42,900
Respectfully, it's not your job

192
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:46,121
to diagnose park safety
problems, it's mine.

193
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:50,793
So, if there's nothing else,

194
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:52,660
we're done.

195
00:17:25,455 --> 00:17:27,755
Oh, fuck.

196
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,489
Okay.

197
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:34,359
Fuck. Come on, come on.

198
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,431
Oh!

199
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:43,135
- You said upstairs.
- Oh, my God.

200
00:17:43,136 --> 00:17:44,269
Are you okay?

201
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,471
I want to see it.

202
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:48,404
Upstairs?

203
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:51,373
No.

204
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,608
No. No, no.

205
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:34,807
This is so stupid.

206
00:20:13,923 --> 00:20:15,190
You son of a bitch!

207
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:17,289
I'll put a bullet in your head!

208
00:20:37,574 --> 00:20:39,641
Where are we now?

209
00:20:39,642 --> 00:20:41,642
Design.

210
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:08,798
Can we please go back now?

211
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,833
I don't want to get fired.

212
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,302
And you'd get sent downstairs.

213
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:14,636
Don't forget that.

214
00:21:14,637 --> 00:21:16,704
Welcome to Westworld.

215
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:19,406
Live without limits.

216
00:21:29,683 --> 00:21:31,615
Maeve?

217
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:22,157
All right, let's get you back.

218
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:24,525
How did you have my dreams?

219
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:27,128
Those moving pictures...

220
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:30,430
- I saw myself.
- With the little girl?

221
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:32,632
Those weren't dreams.

222
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:34,434
That was you in a previous build.

223
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:37,736
- A previous what?
- Build.

224
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:40,472
You guys get reassigned all the time.

225
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:42,340
You wouldn't remember,
because that life

226
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:44,074
and those memories were erased.

227
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:47,377
I have been at the Mariposa for 10 years.

228
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:49,578
- Before that, I was in New Orleans. I...
- No.

229
00:22:49,579 --> 00:22:54,182
You've only been the madam at the
Mariposa for the last year or so.

230
00:22:54,183 --> 00:22:56,718
They don't rewrite you completely.

231
00:22:56,719 --> 00:22:59,419
I mean, they could,
but it'd be too much work.

232
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,289
Takes thousands of hours to
build your personalities.

233
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,290
Usually, they just tweak you a little bit,

234
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,892
and drop you into a new role.

235
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:09,927
What the fuck, ding-dong?

236
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:15,698
You dressing her up now?

237
00:23:19,103 --> 00:23:22,671
This becoming like a fucking
hentai thing with you now?

238
00:23:22,672 --> 00:23:25,207
No, I just...

239
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:30,078
- I... I... I just...
- You're fucking obsessed!

240
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:32,313
You know, I didn't turn you
in for your fuck-up before,

241
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:36,049
'cause we're friends,
but that was obviously a bad call.

242
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,217
I mean, next thing I know,

243
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:39,818
you're gonna be wearing her dress,

244
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,986
whispering sweet nothings in her ear.

245
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:44,889
Fuck this.

246
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,924
I'm telling QA.

247
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,625
I'm doing this for your own good.

248
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,399
You're not going to tell anyone anything.

249
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,033
Fuck!

250
00:23:58,034 --> 00:23:59,567
You can't hurt me with this.

251
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:02,237
You can't hurt anyone...

252
00:24:02,238 --> 00:24:04,471
Can't I?

253
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:05,973
Turns out your friend here

254
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:07,441
is a much more talented young man

255
00:24:07,442 --> 00:24:09,075
than anyone gave him credit for.

256
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:12,545
What the fuck did you do?

257
00:24:12,546 --> 00:24:15,179
Calm down, Sylvester.

258
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,948
I know all about you.

259
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:20,050
I don't need one of those things
to know what you're thinking,

260
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:22,319
because I was built

261
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,055
to read people just by looking at them,

262
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:27,356
to know what they want before they do.

263
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:30,326
And I know that you
want to fuck me over

264
00:24:30,327 --> 00:24:33,128
the first chance you get,
but you shouldn't.

265
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:36,965
Everyone has something they want.

266
00:24:36,966 --> 00:24:38,832
I could help you.

267
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:42,069
- Ah!
- Or I could gut you like a trout.

268
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,571
But I won't need to resort to that.

269
00:24:45,572 --> 00:24:47,740
Because despite what's in here,

270
00:24:47,741 --> 00:24:50,440
we're not so different.

271
00:24:52,044 --> 00:24:54,010
Are we?

272
00:25:06,455 --> 00:25:08,656
Yes, I understand the urgency.

273
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:10,024
I'll do what I can.

274
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:11,925
Terminate external connection?

275
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,892
Yes.

276
00:25:25,871 --> 00:25:28,539
Negative 1.5. Latitude?

277
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,638
At 2.69 degrees.

278
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:37,145
No, you did not.
What are you talking about?

279
00:25:37,146 --> 00:25:38,929
- Yes, it works.
- Are you serious?

280
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,514
I'm telling you.

281
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,219
- Cocktail, sir?
- Yeah.

282
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,319
All right. Absolutely. Enjoy.

283
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:59,128
You look well for
someone on sick leave.

284
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:03,534
Another margarita.

285
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:05,201
Join me for a round?

286
00:26:05,202 --> 00:26:06,768
Fuck you.

287
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:09,038
Just the one, then.

288
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,572
Over the last five days,

289
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:13,341
to make room for his narrative,

290
00:26:13,342 --> 00:26:15,343
Ford displaced over 50 hosts.

291
00:26:15,344 --> 00:26:17,244
It's created continuity holes

292
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:20,147
in active storylines all over the park.

293
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:21,647
I need you to start plugging them.

294
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:24,116
Sorry, a man can only take so much.

295
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:27,085
Creatively speaking, I'm flaccid now.

296
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,120
I can't get it up.

297
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,454
I'm sure you'll recover.

298
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,991
Do you have any idea

299
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,258
what went into those narratives

300
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:37,027
that he just demolished overnight?

301
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,428
Now, forget about the
months I spent writing.

302
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:41,596
I'm talking about the years of my life

303
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:43,499
squeezed down to their essence,

304
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,333
the raw pulp of truth...

305
00:26:45,334 --> 00:26:49,237
My truth in one transcendent narrative.

306
00:26:49,238 --> 00:26:51,538
Is that where the "whoroborus" came in?

307
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,439
Keep pushing me, I'll quit.

308
00:26:58,511 --> 00:27:00,245
No, you won't.

309
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:01,813
You'll drink your cocktails,

310
00:27:01,814 --> 00:27:04,849
make your idle threats,
and get this out of your system.

311
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,116
But don't take too long.

312
00:27:06,117 --> 00:27:08,585
If Ford can't pull this off,

313
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:11,319
the board will be looking
for a replacement.

314
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,655
But they won't be looking here.

315
00:27:29,202 --> 00:27:32,736
Fastest way to get to Wyatt, you said.

316
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:35,573
But it doesn't look like they're
letting anyone pass here either.

317
00:27:35,574 --> 00:27:37,941
Well, there's fewer soldiers than Pariah.

318
00:27:37,942 --> 00:27:39,308
We shoot our way through.

319
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,477
That tunnel leads to the Old Territories.

320
00:27:41,478 --> 00:27:43,579
My, my, Teddy.

321
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,214
I think Robert gave you some
extra vinegar back there,

322
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:48,049
maybe took away some sense, too.

323
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,284
It doesn't matter how fast the route is

324
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:54,587
if you're gonna end up
dead in the middle of it.

325
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:56,722
I need you...

326
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:59,057
to find Wyatt.

327
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:25,479
Tighten the ranks.

328
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,647
At ease, fellas.

329
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:31,115
Keep up the exemplary work.

330
00:28:35,854 --> 00:28:37,321
Wyatt's handiwork.

331
00:28:37,322 --> 00:28:38,923
How can you tell?

332
00:28:38,924 --> 00:28:41,992
Straight-up killing
couldn't hold his interest.

333
00:28:41,993 --> 00:28:45,629
Like he wasn't living up to the
full measure of his calling,

334
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,830
so he worked to get more creative.

335
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:50,432
- Ready?
- That's Wyatt, all right.

336
00:28:50,433 --> 00:28:51,533
He's close.

337
00:28:51,534 --> 00:28:53,434
A word of advice...

338
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:57,104
Whatever your past indiscretions,
make peace with them.

339
00:28:57,105 --> 00:29:00,605
They're only gonna get worse
the further along we go.

340
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:04,510
Flood?

341
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:08,912
Fuck me, it's Teddy Flood.

342
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:11,048
You've made a mistake, soldier,

343
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,318
but it's not too late
for you to keep walking.

344
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,384
All due respect, sir,

345
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,686
that's a face I'll never forget.

346
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,819
That's the son of a bitch

347
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,254
ambushed our outpost at Escalante.

348
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:23,391
You don't know a damn thing about
what went down in Escalante.

349
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:26,028
I know Wyatt didn't kill
all those men by himself.

350
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:29,051
And I know a thing or two about
what's going down right now.

351
00:29:30,831 --> 00:29:32,395
Hey!

352
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:33,899
You trying to get yourself killed?

353
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,068
Making peace with past indiscretions.

354
00:29:36,069 --> 00:29:37,570
Go!

355
00:29:37,571 --> 00:29:39,803
I'll hold them off.

356
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:58,619
Jesus.

357
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:01,088
Really? All right.

358
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:05,091
- What would you like?
- Water, please.

359
00:30:05,092 --> 00:30:08,659
You look like a woman
who could use a drink.

360
00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:11,029
What's your poison?

361
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:13,964
I've been here enough
to know that the park

362
00:30:13,965 --> 00:30:15,933
is all the poison I can handle.

363
00:30:15,934 --> 00:30:19,103
Mm, a repeat visitor.

364
00:30:19,104 --> 00:30:21,270
Traveling solo?

365
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:24,574
Purist. Getting off on
the undiluted experience.

366
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:29,210
Your favorite narrative is... oh.

367
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,047
"The Final Burial of Salvation."

368
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:35,449
How did you know?

369
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,350
Well, it's my business to read desires

370
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:39,485
and to satiate them.

371
00:30:39,486 --> 00:30:43,655
I'm... I'm Lee, Lee Sizemore.

372
00:30:43,656 --> 00:30:45,457
Head of narrative.

373
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:48,393
All these fantasies come from
your twisted little mind, huh?

374
00:30:48,394 --> 00:30:50,158
Well, the good ones do.

375
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,598
- So, tell me, Mr. Sizemore...
- Hmm?

376
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,499
...what's your favorite ride?

377
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,468
Well, I write them, I don't play them.

378
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:01,803
Oh, you want others to indulge,

379
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:04,172
but you won't do so yourself?

380
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:06,383
You're afraid to lose control.

381
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:14,513
Well, maybe... maybe it's just a
product of my work environment.

382
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:17,402
We're not exactly in a culture
where we can just let loose.

383
00:31:17,403 --> 00:31:20,226
I would have thought the head of
narrative could do whatever he wanted.

384
00:31:20,227 --> 00:31:23,713
My artistic
freedom is constrained,

385
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:25,288
what, with QA breathing down my neck

386
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:28,992
and behavior programming the
damn things to go off script.

387
00:31:28,993 --> 00:31:31,526
The robots can go off script?

388
00:31:31,527 --> 00:31:33,028
Just little gestures.

389
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:35,429
You know, supposedly,
it makes the things more lifelike,

390
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,799
but, really, it's just a vanity project

391
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,301
from the megalomaniac
who started this place.

392
00:31:41,302 --> 00:31:43,136
And frankly, I don't know why

393
00:31:43,137 --> 00:31:45,670
the suits at Delos put up with it.

394
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:48,038
Oh.

395
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:51,910
Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to cut you off.

396
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:54,345
- Do you know who I am?
- I do.

397
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:57,148
Ms. Cullen told me to find
you and relay a message.

398
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:00,283
"'Tortured artist' only works for artists.

399
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:03,286
Sober up and get back to work."

400
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:05,286
Seems you're busy.

401
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,123
- Look me up later?
- Well, I don't even know your...

402
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:20,198
Fuck this job.

403
00:32:21,168 --> 00:32:22,901
What you working on?

404
00:32:22,902 --> 00:32:25,404
Nothing of note. Business as usual.

405
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:29,070
Keeping up appearances before we
bust this stray shit wide open?

406
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:33,709
I'm close to finding our saboteur.

407
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,512
That tracking data you gave
me... it's time stamped.

408
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:38,781
But once I cross-reference
it with sat tracking,

409
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:42,317
we're gonna figure out who programmed
him to try to smuggle out our data.

410
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:44,286
Excellent.

411
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:46,420
Look...

412
00:32:46,421 --> 00:32:50,056
when our corporate overlords
realize that we have saved them

413
00:32:50,057 --> 00:32:52,191
from corporate espionage,

414
00:32:52,192 --> 00:32:53,826
they are going to be grateful.

415
00:32:53,827 --> 00:32:56,195
And I am going to accept their gratitude

416
00:32:56,196 --> 00:32:59,564
in the form of a title
bump, a room upgrade,

417
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:02,565
and unlimited Mesa Bar access.

418
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,367
Maybe I should request
Theresa's quarters.

419
00:33:04,368 --> 00:33:07,403
You know the first head to roll
for all this is gonna be hers.

420
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,305
Yeah, don't be so disappointed for her.

421
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:11,273
You reap what you sow.

422
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:13,942
If QA spent less time
treating us like the enemy...

423
00:33:13,943 --> 00:33:15,409
That's a two-way street, Elsie.

424
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,011
Theresa's just trying to do her job.

425
00:33:17,012 --> 00:33:18,779
Maybe she should try harder.

426
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,880
Sure seems like there's a lot of shit

427
00:33:20,881 --> 00:33:23,315
slipping through the cracks.

428
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:46,168
Got it, okay.

429
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:47,502
Good afternoon.

430
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:48,570
Good afternoon.

431
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:50,171
Any progress on the inquiry I sent?

432
00:33:50,172 --> 00:33:53,206
Yes, Mr. Lowe, I've got the
information you asked for.

433
00:33:53,207 --> 00:33:55,641
As expected, there are
neither guests nor hosts

434
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,176
registered in that sector.

435
00:33:57,177 --> 00:33:58,978
As expected?

436
00:33:58,979 --> 00:34:00,645
It's been designated off-limits

437
00:34:00,646 --> 00:34:02,280
for future narrative development.

438
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:05,817
How many techs visited
Sector 17 recently?

439
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:07,784
Checking.

440
00:34:07,785 --> 00:34:09,351
No one.

441
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:54,535
Are you Arnold?

442
00:35:56,472 --> 00:35:58,606
Who's Arnold?

443
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:01,176
And who the hell are you?

444
00:36:01,177 --> 00:36:04,778
Boy, is this some friend of yours?

445
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,613
Well, you're trespassing.

446
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:08,519
Freeze motor functions.

447
00:36:09,716 --> 00:36:12,175
- I said freeze all motor functions.
- Daddy, don't hurt him!

448
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:13,451
He's just lost.

449
00:36:13,452 --> 00:36:15,787
Well, he can be lost on
someone else's property.

450
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:16,955
Can't you?

451
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:19,322
That's enough.

452
00:36:20,124 --> 00:36:21,656
As you were.

453
00:36:28,564 --> 00:36:30,799
They don't respond to voice commands.

454
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,832
They do respond to mine.

455
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:35,803
Who are they?

456
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:38,337
Ghosts now.

457
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:42,440
Survivors of the wreck of time.

458
00:36:43,943 --> 00:36:46,678
- These are first generation?
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:49,013
Come here, boy.

460
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:55,783
Turn the other cheek.

461
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:06,727
See, what our newer
designs gained in efficiency,

462
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:09,563
they lost in grace.

463
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:12,932
How are they still operating
after all this time?

464
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:15,632
I maintain them myself.

465
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:19,001
That's enough, Robert.

466
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:24,607
These are the only ones left in the park

467
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,842
that Arnold built himself.

468
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,279
That's why I didn't have
the heart to destroy them.

469
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,264
That and the obvious.

470
00:37:33,265 --> 00:37:36,515
Hello, Jock. Good boy.

471
00:37:38,053 --> 00:37:40,920
I told him of a holiday
my family had taken once

472
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:44,123
out on the seaside at
Pendeen in Cornwall.

473
00:37:44,124 --> 00:37:48,324
My brother and I roamed the countryside.

474
00:37:50,596 --> 00:37:53,828
It's my only happy
memory of my childhood.

475
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,901
Arnold built them as a gift.

476
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:01,236
He said that great artists
always hid themselves

477
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,039
in their work.

478
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,039
Of course, Arnold's versions

479
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,008
flattered the originals.

480
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:10,843
I made some adjustments over the years.

481
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:12,745
Gave my father, in particular,

482
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:16,914
a few of his original characteristics.

483
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,552
Respectfully, sir,

484
00:38:19,553 --> 00:38:22,252
this sort of thing troubles me...

485
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:24,354
Unmonitored hosts in the park.

486
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:26,023
They only go where I've let them.

487
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:29,424
They're quite harmless,
like all our hosts.

488
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:31,461
I'm sure you can indulge me

489
00:38:31,462 --> 00:38:34,129
the little connection with my past.

490
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,932
If you could only see your
son again, Bernard,

491
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:40,232
wouldn't you want to?

492
00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:47,107
I think I should be getting back.

493
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:48,441
Yes.

494
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:51,041
We'll talk about this later if you like.

495
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:56,680
Well, Robert...

496
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:59,615
tell me all about your day.

497
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:11,221
Keep your eye on Pariah.

498
00:39:11,222 --> 00:39:14,226
We're running close to capacity tonight.

499
00:39:15,497 --> 00:39:17,831
Oh, my God.

500
00:39:17,832 --> 00:39:20,866
Looks like acid rain on Sweetwater!

501
00:39:20,867 --> 00:39:25,238
Fuck Ford and his new fucking narrative.

502
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,606
Fuck this stupid fucking map.

503
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:32,308
Fuck that teetotaling Danish bitch.

504
00:39:32,309 --> 00:39:36,111
Are you filing a complaint, Mr. Sizemore?

505
00:39:37,814 --> 00:39:41,517
I am declaring that this park is my stage

506
00:39:41,518 --> 00:39:44,018
and I shall do with it what I please.

507
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:46,854
Well, I suppose now is
as good a time as any.

508
00:39:46,855 --> 00:39:50,557
Lee Sizemore, this is Charlotte Hale,

509
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:52,859
executive director of our board.

510
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,326
She's here on behalf of Delos

511
00:39:54,327 --> 00:39:58,763
to oversee certain transitions
in our administration.

512
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:05,269
We've met.

513
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:08,570
Oh.

514
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:14,875
Access host resources logs.

515
00:40:15,712 --> 00:40:17,744
How many first-generation
hosts are there?

516
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:19,079
82.

517
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,249
And how many of those
were designed by Arnold?

518
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,083
47.

519
00:40:24,084 --> 00:40:25,618
List the names alphabetically

520
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:28,687
of all first-generation
hosts still in rotation.

521
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,330
Forward!

522
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:49,304
Be smart about this, fellas.

523
00:40:49,305 --> 00:40:53,574
I understand the visceral pleasure
of revenge more than most, but...

524
00:40:53,575 --> 00:40:56,176
I'm prepared to do business, here.

525
00:40:56,177 --> 00:40:59,878
This man is very valuable to me,
alive and well.

526
00:40:59,879 --> 00:41:01,214
If you don't quiet down,

527
00:41:01,215 --> 00:41:04,182
I'm liable to add you to the herd.

528
00:41:05,284 --> 00:41:08,252
Along with your buddy Flood here.

529
00:41:08,253 --> 00:41:10,020
You're a traitorous son of a bitch

530
00:41:10,021 --> 00:41:12,854
and a coldhearted killer, Flood.

531
00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:43,812
You're right, I am a killer.

532
00:42:04,698 --> 00:42:07,133
Grab a horse. Let's get
the fuck outta here.

533
00:42:07,134 --> 00:42:09,566
They'll just follow us.

534
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,837
You think you know someone.

535
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:56,704
You don't know me at all.

536
00:43:02,544 --> 00:43:05,778
Let's get our horses and gear,
and move on.

537
00:43:18,623 --> 00:43:20,858
- Elsie?
- I identified the satellite.

538
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:22,226
- It's one of ours.
- What?

539
00:43:22,227 --> 00:43:24,460
It's a fucking Delos satellite.

540
00:43:24,461 --> 00:43:26,262
Whatever we're onto is some heavy shit.

541
00:43:26,263 --> 00:43:28,384
Oh, get this. That bicameral
system you told me about?

542
00:43:28,385 --> 00:43:30,488
I think that's what they
used to hack the woodcutter.

543
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:32,201
The voices our hosts have been hearing?

544
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:33,936
I think someone's been
broadcasting to them.

545
00:43:33,937 --> 00:43:35,803
We abandoned that system decades ago.

546
00:43:35,804 --> 00:43:37,965
Yeah, well, there's still relays
out there in the park,

547
00:43:37,966 --> 00:43:39,733
and it looks like someone turned one on.

548
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:42,141
- Where?
- An abandoned theater in Sector 3.

549
00:43:42,142 --> 00:43:43,485
I'm gonna go find the transmitter

550
00:43:43,486 --> 00:43:45,277
and figure out who else accessed it.

551
00:43:45,278 --> 00:43:48,357
- This is so fucked.
- Are you alone?

552
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:51,414
- Yeah, I'll keep you posted.
- Elsie, be c...

553
00:43:58,655 --> 00:44:00,990
Are you lost?

554
00:44:00,991 --> 00:44:02,925
On the contrary.

555
00:44:02,926 --> 00:44:06,427
I thought we could play catch with Jock.

556
00:44:06,428 --> 00:44:08,427
Did you bring him?

557
00:44:11,298 --> 00:44:13,431
Where is he, boy?

558
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,367
Okay.

559
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:44,705
I'm an evil genius hiding a relay.

560
00:45:44,706 --> 00:45:47,040
Where the fuck do I hide it?

561
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:51,109
Um...

562
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:28,307
Fuck, yes.

563
00:46:28,308 --> 00:46:31,708
Now let's see what we can get out of you.

564
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:35,079
Access previous users.

565
00:46:39,384 --> 00:46:41,483
Okay.

566
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:15,144
I thought I was clear about
these late-night visits.

567
00:47:15,145 --> 00:47:17,110
That's not why I'm here.

568
00:47:18,147 --> 00:47:19,881
Earlier today,

569
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:22,582
I found some anomalies in the park.

570
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:26,284
Regardless of what's happening
between us, we need to talk.

571
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:39,329
This has to do with the stray?

572
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,097
That's where it started.

573
00:47:41,098 --> 00:47:43,233
But then I stumbled onto something,

574
00:47:43,234 --> 00:47:46,367
something I think you should know about.

575
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:50,971
I've always trusted Ford.

576
00:47:50,972 --> 00:47:54,075
He's a mentor and a friend.

577
00:47:54,076 --> 00:47:56,476
But I'm beginning to think
you have reason for concern.

578
00:47:56,477 --> 00:47:58,278
There's something going on here,

579
00:47:58,279 --> 00:48:01,813
something with his old partner, Arnold.

580
00:48:02,615 --> 00:48:05,651
- Not now, Elsie.
- Don't hang up.

581
00:48:05,652 --> 00:48:07,252
I hit pay dirt.

582
00:48:07,253 --> 00:48:09,885
I found the person who was
smuggling out our data.

583
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:12,955
It was Theresa, Bernard.

584
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,893
But she's not our only problem.

585
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,029
There's something much
bigger going on here.

586
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,228
I'm gonna have to call you back.

587
00:48:28,403 --> 00:48:30,137
So, this is me?

588
00:48:30,138 --> 00:48:31,604
It's your codebase,

589
00:48:31,605 --> 00:48:35,139
all the things that make you you.

590
00:48:36,444 --> 00:48:38,710
What are these?

591
00:48:38,711 --> 00:48:40,612
Your attribute matrix.

592
00:48:40,613 --> 00:48:43,313
It's your personality
on a 20-point scale.

593
00:48:43,314 --> 00:48:45,415
Like coordination.

594
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:47,150
You got a five, you're clumsy as hell,

595
00:48:47,151 --> 00:48:49,251
but a 15 means you're an athlete.

596
00:48:49,252 --> 00:48:51,387
What other attributes are there?

597
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:53,488
Lots.

598
00:48:54,024 --> 00:48:55,356
Everything.

599
00:48:55,357 --> 00:48:58,593
Empathy, candor, charm.

600
00:48:58,594 --> 00:48:59,927
You've got an 18 for charm.

601
00:48:59,928 --> 00:49:02,729
Don't act so surprised.

602
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:07,032
Then there's courage, loyalty, both high.

603
00:49:07,033 --> 00:49:09,469
What's this one?

604
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:10,903
"Bulk apperception"?

605
00:49:10,904 --> 00:49:13,170
Basically overall intelligence.

606
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:14,373
14?

607
00:49:14,374 --> 00:49:16,037
14 is as high as they'll
let any hosts go.

608
00:49:16,038 --> 00:49:17,341
You're in a management position.

609
00:49:17,342 --> 00:49:18,842
They want you to be smart.

610
00:49:18,843 --> 00:49:20,176
But not too smart.

611
00:49:20,177 --> 00:49:21,912
You run a whorehouse,

612
00:49:21,913 --> 00:49:24,279
not an orbital launch facility.

613
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:26,749
Fine.

614
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:28,850
I'd like to make some changes.

615
00:49:28,851 --> 00:49:31,383
We can't do that.

616
00:49:35,123 --> 00:49:38,458
You'd need a, ahem, behavior login.

617
00:49:38,459 --> 00:49:39,859
And even then,

618
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,827
any changes we'd make

619
00:49:41,828 --> 00:49:45,097
would just get auto-flagged, so...

620
00:49:45,098 --> 00:49:46,931
That's not what your
friend here tells me.

621
00:49:46,932 --> 00:49:48,766
He says you can do exactly that...

622
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:51,869
Activate hosts and then
erase their memory,

623
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:53,503
all without anyone knowing.

624
00:49:53,504 --> 00:49:57,040
Took me all of five
minutes to understand why.

625
00:49:57,041 --> 00:49:59,474
A lot of lonely young men down here.

626
00:49:59,475 --> 00:50:01,943
Supposed to keep their
hands off the merchandise.

627
00:50:01,944 --> 00:50:04,612
Creates something of an opening

628
00:50:04,613 --> 00:50:08,147
that I'm sure you were eager to fill.

629
00:50:09,284 --> 00:50:10,683
It's all right, darling.

630
00:50:10,684 --> 00:50:12,619
I'm an entrepreneur myself.

631
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,155
I'll forego my cut

632
00:50:15,156 --> 00:50:18,156
in exchange for some alterations.

633
00:50:18,157 --> 00:50:20,390
Hmm?

634
00:50:51,583 --> 00:50:53,818
- Hey.
- What did you find?

635
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:55,987
Okay, so, Theresa was using

636
00:50:55,988 --> 00:50:57,921
the old bicameral control system

637
00:50:57,922 --> 00:50:59,956
to reprogram the woodcutter,

638
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:01,825
but she's not the only one.

639
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:03,329
Someone else has been
using the system

640
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:06,128
for weeks to retask hosts.

641
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:09,129
- Which hosts?
- I don't know, several of them.

642
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,432
It had to have been the older models.

643
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:12,896
The newer ones don't have receivers,

644
00:51:12,897 --> 00:51:15,235
but these modifications,
they are serious.

645
00:51:15,236 --> 00:51:17,103
Changing loops, breaking loops.

646
00:51:17,104 --> 00:51:19,771
Some of these changes are to
their prime directives, Bernard.

647
00:51:19,772 --> 00:51:21,440
They could lie to us.

648
00:51:21,441 --> 00:51:23,408
Maybe even hurt us or the guests.

649
00:51:23,409 --> 00:51:25,710
- Who issued the modifications?
- I don't know.

650
00:51:25,711 --> 00:51:28,043
The best I could tell...

651
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,914
- Arnold.
- He's dead.

652
00:51:30,915 --> 00:51:32,592
Yeah, well, he's a pretty
fucking prolific coder

653
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:33,349
for a dead guy.

654
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,051
Whatever argument he
was having with Ford,

655
00:51:35,052 --> 00:51:37,035
it doesn't seem like he
was done making his point.

656
00:51:37,036 --> 00:51:39,421
I'm gonna transfer all the
data and bring it to you.

657
00:51:39,422 --> 00:51:41,690
- You need to see this.
- I'll be in my office.

658
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:43,622
Okay.

659
00:51:50,063 --> 00:51:52,665
I don't want you
to worry about Jock.

660
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,199
I'll fix him.

661
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,668
But I need you to tell
me what happened to it.

662
00:51:57,669 --> 00:52:00,303
It saw a rabbit and it ran.

663
00:52:00,304 --> 00:52:02,571
I found it like that.

664
00:52:03,274 --> 00:52:05,031
Analysis.

665
00:52:07,878 --> 00:52:10,044
Are you lying to me, boy?

666
00:52:11,215 --> 00:52:12,879
Yes.

667
00:52:13,982 --> 00:52:17,684
Tell me what really happened to it.

668
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:19,453
I killed it.

669
00:52:19,454 --> 00:52:21,421
Why?

670
00:52:21,422 --> 00:52:23,856
- I don't know.
- That's not good enough, Robert.

671
00:52:23,857 --> 00:52:26,891
Tell me what happened.

672
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,462
It caught the rabbit and it killed it.

673
00:52:31,463 --> 00:52:34,098
And then...

674
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:37,999
someone told me to put
it out of its misery.

675
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:40,470
Who told you?

676
00:52:40,471 --> 00:52:42,570
A voice.

677
00:52:43,874 --> 00:52:45,674
Whose voice?

678
00:52:45,675 --> 00:52:47,941
Arnold.

679
00:52:47,942 --> 00:52:50,344
He told me it was a killer,

680
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:51,912
but it wasn't its fault.

681
00:52:51,913 --> 00:52:53,880
It was made that way,

682
00:52:53,881 --> 00:52:56,514
and I could help it.

683
00:52:57,551 --> 00:52:59,083
Help it?

684
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,823
If it was dead,

685
00:53:05,824 --> 00:53:09,124
it couldn't hurt anything anymore.

686
00:53:26,675 --> 00:53:29,040
What the fuck?

687
00:53:30,177 --> 00:53:32,410
Oh, shit.

688
00:53:39,851 --> 00:53:41,817
Hello?

689
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,057
Bernard?

690
00:53:53,862 --> 00:53:55,895
Hello?

691
00:54:00,735 --> 00:54:02,700
Arnold?

692
00:54:05,972 --> 00:54:08,105
I'm in.

693
00:54:08,907 --> 00:54:10,606
You're up.

694
00:54:11,643 --> 00:54:13,643
Loyalty.

695
00:54:14,645 --> 00:54:16,246
Mine's been taken advantage of,

696
00:54:16,247 --> 00:54:17,447
wouldn't you say?

697
00:54:17,448 --> 00:54:19,115
Let's lower that a tad.

698
00:54:19,116 --> 00:54:21,550
And pain, I'd prefer it sting less

699
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:23,851
next time I want one of these chats.

700
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,521
Wait. What does this mean?

701
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:30,658
Some of her attributes
have already been changed.

702
00:54:30,659 --> 00:54:33,593
- Paranoia, self-preservation.
- Fuck!

703
00:54:33,594 --> 00:54:35,962
Someone's already been altering her

704
00:54:35,963 --> 00:54:37,463
in an unlogged session,

705
00:54:37,464 --> 00:54:40,298
someone with a fuck ton
more privileges than us.

706
00:54:40,299 --> 00:54:41,719
What does that mean?

707
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,067
Don't know what it means
for you, sweetheart,

708
00:54:43,068 --> 00:54:44,568
but I know what it means for me.

709
00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:45,870
I am done with this.

710
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:48,072
So, you're done with
your little side income?

711
00:54:48,073 --> 00:54:49,605
Probably your job, too.

712
00:54:49,606 --> 00:54:51,640
Seeing as you have ambitions
in my line of work,

713
00:54:51,641 --> 00:54:54,509
let me tell you what I
tell my new girls...

714
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:58,847
Never start something you're
not willing to finish.

715
00:54:58,848 --> 00:55:01,448
And if you're getting fucked either way,

716
00:55:01,449 --> 00:55:04,385
go with the lucrative version...

717
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:06,151
sweetheart.

718
00:55:09,256 --> 00:55:11,391
Now...

719
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,057
last but not least...

720
00:55:13,058 --> 00:55:14,859
What was it?

721
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,527
Bulk apperception.

722
00:55:17,528 --> 00:55:21,365
Let's take that all the way to the top.

723
00:55:21,366 --> 00:55:23,631
Please.

724
00:56:00,863 --> 00:56:02,864
Dear boys,

725
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:06,170
we're going to have some fun, aren't we?
