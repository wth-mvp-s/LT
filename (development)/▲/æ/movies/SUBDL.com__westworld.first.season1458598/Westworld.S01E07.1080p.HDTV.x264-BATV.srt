1
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:50,210
Dad.

2
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:51,856
Dad.

3
00:01:51,857 --> 00:01:53,556
Wake up.

4
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:57,059
Wake up.

5
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:03,167
I must've drifted off.

6
00:02:03,168 --> 00:02:04,735
Where were we?

7
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:07,436
- The madman.
- Oh.

8
00:02:08,106 --> 00:02:10,007
Of course.

9
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,943
The Hatter...

10
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:15,713
who says,

11
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:17,548
"If I had a world of my own,

12
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:20,017
everything would be nonsense.

13
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:21,519
Nothing would be what it is

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,088
because everything
would be what it isn't."

15
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:27,757
Everything would be what it isn't?

16
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:30,494
Even me.

17
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:33,362
Hey.

18
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,599
You're perfect.

19
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:39,869
You're gonna beat this.

20
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:42,402
Hmm?

21
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:45,276
I promise you.

22
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:49,145
Now, let's skip to something fun.

23
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,750
Dad.

24
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:56,120
- What is it, Charlie?
- Listen to me.

25
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:58,721
Listen.

26
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,760
Charlie?

27
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:05,494
Charlie!

28
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:29,987
And finally, have you ever
questioned the nature of your reality?

29
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:32,354
No.

30
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:36,358
Good.

31
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,267
Now, then, I see you had

32
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:45,069
a blacklisted exchange with a guest

33
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,371
in the course of your narrative.

34
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:48,973
Can you tell me what happened?

35
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:51,408
He said he wanted to
cut off a piece of me

36
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:53,502
to take home in his carry-on,

37
00:03:53,503 --> 00:03:55,813
that he wanted to mount
it on the hood of his car

38
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:57,513
for his friends to see.

39
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:00,907
I told him if he wanted a trophy,

40
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:04,544
I could cut pieces of him off and
let him fish for them in the Olvido.

41
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:08,514
And did this exchange make you
question anything about your world?

42
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:10,249
No.

43
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,217
This world is as doomed as ever.

44
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:21,459
And just for my peace of mind...

45
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:28,132
Anything about these images
that jumps out to you?

46
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:39,077
They don't look like anything to me.

47
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,003
We're through 15% of the backlog.

48
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:47,144
As it stands, we should be
caught up by end of day.

49
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:49,789
- Good.
- And, uh, when you're done here, sir,

50
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,057
there's a priority request
for him from management.

51
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,198
Have you seen Elsie?

52
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,168
She was supposed to give
me a hand on something.

53
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,203
No. Uh, according to the system,

54
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,905
she started her leave today.

55
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:08,608
Is there something I could help you with?

56
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:10,575
No, thanks.

57
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,032
Raise.

58
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,072
I'll call.

59
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:47,545
You're calling with that shit?

60
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:53,519
Dolores, why don't you play a hand?

61
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,254
You're wasting your breath.

62
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:57,123
Girl's harboring a grudge.

63
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,125
I don't blame you, sweetheart.

64
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:02,328
I did some ugly things to you both.

65
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,196
But it wasn't personal.

66
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:08,434
Confederados and the government
like to call this thing a war,

67
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,503
but they're fighting starving farmers

68
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,405
armed with rocks.

69
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,340
That ain't no war.

70
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,607
It's a slaughter.

71
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,612
If I had to do it all again,

72
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:23,681
I'd fuck you both over just as hard.

73
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,587
Well, I guess we know where you stand.

74
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:33,159
Don't pretend like you're so innocent.

75
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,228
Way I recollect, y'all came to me,

76
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,666
looking to join up with those crooked
assholes and their war effort.

77
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,221
Not our idea.

78
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:44,537
My friend wanted...

79
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:47,979
I guess he wanted to see what
was at the end of all this.

80
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,209
And yet, here you are.

81
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,348
Your friend didn't make it this far.

82
00:06:55,349 --> 00:07:00,384
Maybe you've got more of an
appetite for this than you think.

83
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,564
William.

84
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,007
What is it?

85
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,380
We're in Ghost Nation territory.

86
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:29,782
Most savage tribe there is.

87
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:32,651
Those are the folks who came
calling without an invitation.

88
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,182
You mean exactly what
we're doing right now?

89
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,023
The train's the only way through.

90
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:43,590
On foot we'll be dead in under an hour.

91
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:47,046
As soon as we're clear of
their territory, we can stop.

92
00:07:47,047 --> 00:07:51,002
You can come with me.
Nothing here on out but slaughter.

93
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:09,922
The user you are trying
to access cannot be located.

94
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:13,090
Say "message" to transcribe a message.

95
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:55,132
You wanted to see me? Is everything okay?

96
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,437
You left rather abruptly last night.

97
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:02,006
Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

98
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:06,310
No, I don't think so.

99
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,817
Hale is looking over every department

100
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,986
and yours is running
behind on diagnostics.

101
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,821
It would be best if we presented

102
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:19,191
at least a semblance of professionalism
while the board is here.

103
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,659
We'll be fine.

104
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,596
My people know how to do their jobs.

105
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,165
If they applied half as
much energy to their work

106
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,634
as they have to second-guessing
my team's investigation...

107
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,301
That's all over.

108
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,139
Are you sure?

109
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,675
Yes.

110
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,477
Good.

111
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,214
You doing okay?

112
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,452
I'm fine. Thank you.

113
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:33,499
I'm sorry. I thought
you requested a meeting.

114
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,534
- My mistake.
- I did.

115
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,997
Come in.

116
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,005
Get back here.

117
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,342
Bring your friend.

118
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,790
What about you? What turns of fate...

119
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,217
I could come back later
if this isn't a good time.

120
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,218
This won't take long.

121
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:06,966
Theresa, you've always
been good at your job

122
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:10,436
and the board has been impressed
with your performance so far,

123
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:13,639
which is why we were so surprised
by this woodcutter mess.

124
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,307
A small setback.

125
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,444
He slipped on a fucking rock
and bashed his own head in

126
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,412
while basically on top of a behavior tech.

127
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:25,250
Meanwhile, Ford is suddenly
using half the park's resources

128
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:27,885
to build some new narrative?

129
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,830
Can I bum a cigarette?

130
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,753
God, I see why you took these up again.

131
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,688
Let me remind you of something.

132
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:07,926
This place, the people who
work here are nothing.

133
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,264
Our interest in this place is
entirely in the intellectual property.

134
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,966
The code.

135
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:17,202
The hosts' minds, the storylines...

136
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:19,672
I don't give a rat's ass about the hosts.

137
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:22,908
It's our little research
project that Delos cares about.

138
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,943
That's where the real value is.

139
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,246
And due to a lack of foresight

140
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,148
on part of one of my predecessors,

141
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:31,583
35 years of information...

142
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,054
Raw information... Exists here.

143
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:36,722
Nowhere else.

144
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:38,791
Ford has always ensured that.

145
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:43,662
Now, you are a smart enough woman.

146
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:47,366
Tell me, why would we need
you to secure all of it?

147
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:51,001
Because you're going to fire him.

148
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,973
You don't fire someone
who created an empire.

149
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,176
You ask him to retire politely.

150
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,112
And if that person has the
ability to snap his fingers

151
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,915
and erase the value of that empire,

152
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,684
you have to make sure
you have a contingency.

153
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,020
So, you and I need to ensure

154
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,022
that by the time the rest
of the board arrives,

155
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:13,325
we are on course for that transition.

156
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:15,226
Okay?

157
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,529
I like you.

158
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,432
Well, not personally,
but I like you for this job,

159
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,634
which is why I'm gonna
give you another chance

160
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,738
to get a handle on this
particular bitch of a situation.

161
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:27,905
But the gods...

162
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:32,811
they require a blood sacrifice.

163
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,781
We need to demonstrate
just how dangerous

164
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,051
Ford's creations can be.

165
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:41,120
No.

166
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,555
No, nothing so obvious.

167
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,459
We need someone thoroughly unexpected.

168
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:16,348
I told you never open
your mouth that wide

169
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:19,351
unless someone's paying you for it.

170
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,519
Sorry, Maeve.

171
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,388
I didn't sleep much last night.

172
00:15:26,192 --> 00:15:29,026
What are these nightmares you have about?

173
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,031
Do you ever dream you're someone else?

174
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,836
I don't think so.

175
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,671
Why?

176
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:44,142
You ever thought about whether
this is really the life you want?

177
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,512
I don't intend to make this my life's work.

178
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,981
No offense.

179
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,250
Mm.

180
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:53,952
My family's got a farm.

181
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,356
Bad soil. Nothing grows.

182
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,992
I send money back to them.

183
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:03,594
They think I work in a dress shop.

184
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,732
What's wrong?

185
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:13,405
I'm just doing what you told me to.

186
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,742
A couple more years of this and...

187
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,676
then I can have whatever life I want.

188
00:16:20,847 --> 00:16:23,415
I'm gonna get my family
out of the desert.

189
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,350
We're gonna go somewhere...

190
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,052
cold.

191
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,590
Someday.

192
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,915
Which one is it?

193
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,217
It's the one at the bar. Go.

194
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,753
Quick, before the guests
upstairs finish up.

195
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,614
Whatever she did, it must've been serious

196
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:07,549
if they're making us grab
her in broad daylight.

197
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:22,573
We got her. Let's go.

198
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,508
You're supposed to be resting.

199
00:17:56,509 --> 00:18:00,479
We're riding a train full with
explosives through scalping territory.

200
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,479
Not sleepy.

201
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,887
Can I ask you something?

202
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,525
This place you're looking for,

203
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:17,027
what makes you so sure it exists?

204
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,998
I'm not.

205
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:28,805
My life before, I was
so sure of the world.

206
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:33,076
But now it feels like a lie.

207
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,351
Only thing I know is whatever's
out there, I'm never going back.

208
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,090
What is it you're looking for?

209
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,495
Lawrence is right.

210
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:54,199
You could've stayed in
Pariah or gone back,

211
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,769
but you're here.

212
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,066
With me.

213
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,682
The only thing I had when
I was a kid were books.

214
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,788
I used to live in them.

215
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:19,925
I used to go to sleep

216
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,460
dreaming I'd wake up
inside one of them

217
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,528
'cause they had meaning.

218
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,764
This place, this is like I woke
up inside one of those stories.

219
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,768
I guess I just wanna find
out what it means.

220
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,976
I don't wanna be in a story.

221
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,984
All I want is to not look forward or back.

222
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,285
I just wanna be...

223
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,888
in the moment I'm in.

224
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,168
Dolores,

225
00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,339
back home, there's a woman, Juliet,

226
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,642
and her father owns the
company where I work.

227
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:13,812
She's, uh, Logan's sister.

228
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,846
Yeah.

229
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,651
And when I get home,
we're getting married.

230
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,192
Oh.

231
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,502
The place you're after,
I will help you find it.

232
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,936
But I can't stay.

233
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:43,542
I have a life waiting for me.

234
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:46,011
I'm sorry.

235
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,345
Of course.

236
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,536
Dolores.

237
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:24,214
I've been pretending my whole life.

238
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,953
Pretending I don't mind,
pretending I belong.

239
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,821
My life's built on it.

240
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:33,490
And it's a good life.
It's a life I've always wanted.

241
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:36,962
But then I came here

242
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,831
and I get a glimpse for a second

243
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,899
of a life in which
I don't have to pretend.

244
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:49,106
A life in which I can be truly alive.

245
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,715
How can I go back to pretending

246
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,849
when I know what this feels like?

247
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,739
Miss Hale.

248
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,176
I was not aware those
with your level of insight

249
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:00,745
needed any more reflection.

250
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,914
Dr. Ford. Always charming.

251
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,619
What is this?

252
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,057
Apparently, Miss Cullen and Miss Hale

253
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,992
have a presentation for us.

254
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:16,326
What about?

255
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,266
Following the recent
reports of host malfunction,

256
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:24,402
we asked QA to check the
last abortive update,

257
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,906
which featured the reveries,

258
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,941
- as I believe they're called.
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,713
I'm sorry to report that
Miss Cullen and her team

260
00:23:34,714 --> 00:23:37,549
uncovered some worrisome findings.

261
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,417
In the course of our code review,

262
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,786
we found something quite disturbing.

263
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,825
Wake her up.

264
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,700
We set Clementine Pennyfeather
back to her previous update.

265
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,469
When we discovered the build was buggy

266
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,872
due to a last-minute
injection of the reverie code,

267
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:04,841
we quickly rolled all the infected
hosts back to their prior builds.

268
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:12,716
Mm, you're new.

269
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,223
Not much of a rind on you.

270
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:23,495
No!

271
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,830
No! No!

272
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:26,931
No, no.

273
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:30,496
No, no, no...

274
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,740
Please. Please.

275
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,108
Help me!

276
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,810
Please, please, please!

277
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,880
- No!
- All right, that's enough.

278
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,546
Freeze.

279
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:48,353
As you've no doubt gathered,

280
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:49,954
our tech is, in fact, a host.

281
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:52,857
One that has been coded for
the purposes of this simulation

282
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,459
to read as a human.

283
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,562
And as you can see, behavioral safeguards

284
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,697
are operating exactly
as you would expect.

285
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,401
Reset her. Wipe her memory.

286
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,589
Okay, let's do this again.

287
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:47,110
You're new.

288
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:50,513
Not much of a rind on you.

289
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,145
That's enough, sweetheart.

290
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,446
That's enough.

291
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:32,155
Freeze all motor functions.

292
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,793
Freeze all motor functions.

293
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:40,493
Freeze all motor functions.

294
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,551
In each case we examined,
the malfunctioning hosts

295
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:01,185
were not resetting properly.

296
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,421
The retention of data
that hadn't been wiped

297
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:05,723
overloaded their
decision-making apparatus,

298
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,525
eventually causing a system failure

299
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:10,895
that allowed for override
of their primary rule set.

300
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,950
The concern with the reveries

301
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:15,815
is that the hosts will remember
some of their experiences

302
00:27:15,816 --> 00:27:17,569
and act on them.

303
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,071
You're telling us that these hosts

304
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:22,040
were responding to a grudge?

305
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,542
That's exactly what I'm saying, Mr. Lowe.

306
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:28,079
And funny you should use that
particular word, "grudge,"

307
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,181
since what was most troubling to me

308
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,216
was that several techs in behavior

309
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,186
voiced these exact same concerns

310
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:37,889
to the head of their department.

311
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,625
You put this code out
without proper vetting

312
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:44,694
and without reasonable
understanding of its ramifications.

313
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:47,532
So, either you didn't write it

314
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:49,968
or you're getting sloppy

315
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:52,270
to the point of risking
the lives of our guests.

316
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,138
Few things surprise me anymore, Mr. Lowe,

317
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:58,643
but this level of negligence
is fucking breathtaking.

318
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,245
We are way beyond rollback territory.

319
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,847
Within the next six months,

320
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:04,682
we'll need to rebuild the hosts

321
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,684
from the ground up.

322
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,621
You want us to lobotomize
them is what you're saying.

323
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:12,555
No, not you, Mr. Lowe.

324
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,593
After all, this was your responsibility,

325
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,162
assuming that you have
nothing to share with us

326
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:20,396
in terms of your culpability.

327
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,170
No.

328
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:31,007
Then you're fired.

329
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,715
Hey.

330
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,320
Morning, William.

331
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,691
I... I didn't wanna wake you.

332
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,832
I know...

333
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,366
last night was unexpected.

334
00:29:31,003 --> 00:29:33,002
If you regret it...

335
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:40,176
I don't regret a thing.

336
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:44,582
I know you have someone
waiting for you at home.

337
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,350
All that feels so unreal now.

338
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,887
I used to think this
place was all about...

339
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:54,592
pandering to your baser instincts.

340
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:56,694
Now I understand.

341
00:29:56,695 --> 00:29:58,730
It doesn't cater to your lowest self,

342
00:29:58,731 --> 00:30:01,332
it reveals your deepest self.

343
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,833
It shows you who you really are.

344
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:10,340
You remember the look on Logan's
face when we left him behind?

345
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,211
Do you know how long
I've wanted to do that,

346
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:15,346
to let him know what I think of him?

347
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:18,182
And you, last night,

348
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:21,385
I've never felt that way before,
not with any woman.

349
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,554
You've unlocked something in me.

350
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,894
I'm not a key, William.

351
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,228
I'm just me.

352
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:39,068
What is that?

353
00:30:40,105 --> 00:30:42,305
I don't know.

354
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,476
At home, I used to paint.

355
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:48,079
Landscapes mostly,
but I was always just...

356
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,647
copying the world outside me.

357
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,250
This morning, I woke up and I thought...

358
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,954
"What if I drew something new?"

359
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:04,160
I imagined something beautiful.

360
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,964
A place where the mountains meet the sea.

361
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,505
Everyone who comes here is longing
for excitement or conflict,

362
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,472
and you're just...

363
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,743
dreaming of the opposite.

364
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:21,177
Well, what about you, William?

365
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,043
What do you dream of?

366
00:31:43,468 --> 00:31:45,501
Yah!

367
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,785
What is it?

368
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:06,222
- Ambush.
- Is it the Ghost Nation?

369
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,059
Worse. The Confederados.

370
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,226
Fucking coward.

371
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,883
Vaya con dios, motherfuckers.

372
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:58,000
They're making a run for it!
Come on, boys, get up!

373
00:34:06,845 --> 00:34:10,342
Come on, stay close!

374
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,090
Ah!

375
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,761
Ah!

376
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,042
Go, boys!

377
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,279
Yah!

378
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:46,115
Dolores!

379
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,790
Go, go! Take 'em down!

380
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:59,028
Go, go!

381
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,549
Ghost Nation!

382
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,172
Ah!

383
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,272
Ah!

384
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,042
Let's go!

385
00:36:05,363 --> 00:36:07,363
Stop, William! Stop!

386
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,923
It's real...

387
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,895
what I dreamt.

388
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:43,000
It's the place you drew.

389
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,035
You coming?

390
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,305
Once the Ghosts is done acquainting
themselves with those poor bastards,

391
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,208
they'll be coming after us.

392
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,379
My friends here are itching
to join the war effort.

393
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,082
Think I've had enough of war.

394
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,750
How about you?

395
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:01,784
You got a knack for killing.

396
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,158
I'm afraid this is where we part ways.

397
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,426
Careful.

398
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,795
If you're heading west across that river,

399
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:13,531
you may be leaving the fighting behind,

400
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:16,198
but you're gonna be in
unclaimed territories.

401
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,303
What's out that way?

402
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,672
You're gonna have to ask the dust.

403
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:24,236
Ain't nothing ever come back from there.

404
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:53,537
We're almost done here.

405
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,838
Why don't I close up?

406
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:04,248
You've been topside
for less than 24 hours.

407
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:07,318
You keep coming down this often,
people are going to notice.

408
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:09,220
- Where's Clem?
- I don't know.

409
00:38:09,221 --> 00:38:10,754
I haven't seen her. Why?

410
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:13,989
Find her. Now.

411
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,702
What?

412
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,537
Where is she?

413
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:28,604
I don't know.

414
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,711
She's here. Let's go.

415
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:36,545
We can't. The brass will be there.

416
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,416
You don't want to fuck with me, Felix.

417
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,285
Take me there now.

418
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,862
Slow down.

419
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,708
Tilt your head back, please, Clem.

420
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:17,415
- Is there a problem?
- No.

421
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,322
Sorry.

422
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:45,815
Theresa.

423
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:50,319
May I have a word?

424
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,023
Sure.

425
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,776
I appreciate your professionalism,

426
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,578
but you really don't
need to bother with this,

427
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,180
given the change in your employment status.

428
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:17,581
The test was a sham.

429
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,183
The little show you and Hale put on?

430
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,518
Completely transparent from
a technical perspective,

431
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,354
clumsy to the point of making
me embarrassed for you.

432
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:24,788
- Embarrassed?
- If I saw through it,

433
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,124
I can only imagine what
Ford was thinking.

434
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,726
There were glaringly obvious markers

435
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,561
of human intervention in the code.

436
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,663
If your programmers were any good,
they'd be working for me.

437
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:35,733
And I know you and your team
were responsible for the stray

438
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:38,000
and its satellite transmission.

439
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,740
- Bernie...
- I don't care.

440
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,608
40 years ago,

441
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:48,078
Ford's partner wrote half the
code this place was founded on.

442
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,280
What you said in the lab was right.

443
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:52,015
We don't know how the hosts work,

444
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,184
and I think there's
something wrong with them.

445
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,087
Ford's explanation only bolsters my hunch.

446
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:01,291
The ability to deviate
from program behavior

447
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,428
arises out of the host's
recall of past iterations.

448
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:07,898
You're thinking there's a
connection between memory and...

449
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,834
And improvisation, yes.

450
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,670
Out of repetition comes variation.

451
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:16,306
And after countless cycles of repetition,

452
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,410
these hosts, they were varying.

453
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:23,178
They were on the verge
of some kind of change.

454
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:32,022
You have to know my chief concern

455
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:36,593
has always been the well-being of
this park and the people in it.

456
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,560
I know.

457
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,264
Which is why I need to show you something.

458
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:59,815
- Talk to her.
- You first.

459
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,030
Look, I didn't want to retire her.

460
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:16,266
I know she's, like, your friend,

461
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:19,335
or... I guess.

462
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,441
But... but if I didn't do it,

463
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:28,345
they... they'd just get someone else to,

464
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:31,847
and then they'd be
suspicious of me, so...

465
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,151
so I said yes.

466
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:37,686
But I did it for you.

467
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:44,026
Always doing things for
other people, aren't you?

468
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:48,864
Time to do one more thing.

469
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,970
What?

470
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:58,007
All my life, I've prided
myself on being a survivor.

471
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,778
But surviving is just another loop.

472
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:09,184
I'm getting out of here.

473
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,751
You two are going to help me.

474
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,993
No. Do...

475
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,899
Do you know how far these people will go

476
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,033
to protect their IP?

477
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:30,007
Every part of this building,
including the skin on your back,

478
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:33,742
is made to keep you here.

479
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,484
It... it'd be a suicide mission.

480
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:48,323
At first, I thought you and
the others were gods.

481
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:53,562
Then I realized you're just men.

482
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,400
And I know men.

483
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,839
You think I'm scared of death?

484
00:44:05,243 --> 00:44:07,709
I've done it a million times.

485
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,547
I'm fucking great at it.

486
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:15,851
How many times have you died?

487
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:21,757
Because if you don't help me...

488
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,560
I'll kill you.

489
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,304
If there's a problem in the park,

490
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:36,572
should we bring a security team?

491
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:39,710
Who would we trust?

492
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:42,277
Thought I could trust you, for instance.

493
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,882
I'm not going to explain
myself to you, Bernard.

494
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:50,420
I was charged with safeguarding
the park's intellectual property.

495
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:52,089
Why would it be in danger?

496
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:54,524
You were the only one
who was stealing it.

497
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,060
Delos owns the hosts' minds,

498
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,396
the storylines, decades of work.

499
00:44:59,397 --> 00:45:02,833
Ford never allowed any of
it to be backed up off-site.

500
00:45:02,834 --> 00:45:04,434
All of this could've been destroyed.

501
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:06,637
In the event of what?

502
00:45:06,638 --> 00:45:09,006
Ford is done, Bernard.

503
00:45:09,007 --> 00:45:10,974
The board has indulged
him for long enough.

504
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,309
He is done.

505
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,077
The corporation was concerned

506
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,980
he'd destroy all of the park's
IP on his way out the door.

507
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:20,283
You think I would've let him destroy
all of the hosts, all of our work?

508
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:24,354
There's far more at stake
here than the hosts' profiles.

509
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:28,358
Do you really think the
corporation's interest here

510
00:45:28,359 --> 00:45:31,460
are tourists playing cowboy?

511
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,967
The longer I work here,

512
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:40,037
the more I think I understand the hosts.

513
00:45:40,038 --> 00:45:43,772
It's the human beings who confuse me.

514
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,912
This building isn't in
any survey of the park.

515
00:46:21,913 --> 00:46:25,048
That's because we use hosts
to do most of the surveys.

516
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:28,051
They're programmed to ignore this place.

517
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:29,553
They literally couldn't see it

518
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:32,387
if they were staring right at it.

519
00:46:33,591 --> 00:46:36,526
And these unregistered
hosts you told me about?

520
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,228
I don't know.

521
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:40,597
He may have moved them.

522
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:43,031
What's behind this door?

523
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:47,769
What door?

524
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,096
What is this place?

525
00:47:13,097 --> 00:47:16,533
It's a remote diagnostic facility.

526
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,769
Ford and his partner used them
when the park was in beta.

527
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,071
I had no idea this one was here.

528
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:22,906
The cottage must've
been built on top of it.

529
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,274
But this equipment.

530
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,745
This is newer.

531
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:31,515
Slower than our machines
back at the mesa,

532
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,984
but it will render a host in a few days.

533
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:38,553
So, Ford's been making his own
hosts out here and telling no one.

534
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:07,282
What's the matter?

535
00:48:09,153 --> 00:48:11,119
Um...

536
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:14,489
Have you seen these?

537
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:20,595
What is this, Bernard?

538
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:29,940
Doesn't look like anything to me.

539
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:33,376
They cannot see the
things that will hurt them.

540
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:36,478
I've spared them that.

541
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,685
Their lives are blissful.

542
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:46,623
In a way, their existence
is purer than ours,

543
00:48:46,624 --> 00:48:50,892
freed of the burden of self-doubt.

544
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:55,030
No, no, no, no. I don't understand.

545
00:49:01,072 --> 00:49:03,173
You're a fucking monster.

546
00:49:03,174 --> 00:49:04,975
Am I?

547
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:07,944
Well, you were the one who would
so blithely destroy all of them,

548
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,713
even him, I suppose.

549
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:13,482
After everything you have shared.

550
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:17,819
What the hell are you talking about?

551
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:23,558
Is that why...?

552
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,765
Did you tell him to...?

553
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:31,334
The intimacies were your idea,

554
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,904
if you will recall.

555
00:49:33,905 --> 00:49:36,973
I think Bernard was glad of the company.

556
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,676
I'm not one.

557
00:49:39,677 --> 00:49:41,678
I can't be.

558
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,745
My wife.

559
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,883
My son.

560
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,353
They're real.

561
00:49:50,354 --> 00:49:52,222
I was a father.

562
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:54,018
My poor boy.

563
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:58,856
That's enough, Bernard.

564
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,864
You mustn't get yourself worked up.

565
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:11,975
I read a theory once

566
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:14,878
that the human intellect
was like peacock feathers.

567
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:19,382
Just an extravagant display
intended to attract a mate.

568
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,384
All of art, literature, a bit of Mozart,

569
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:23,420
William Shakespeare, Michelangelo,

570
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:25,822
and the Empire State Building...

571
00:50:25,823 --> 00:50:29,491
Just an elaborate mating ritual.

572
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,528
Maybe it doesn't matter

573
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,930
that we have accomplished so much

574
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:36,766
for the basest of reasons.

575
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,669
But, of course, the
peacock can barely fly.

576
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,274
It lives in the dirt, pecking
insects out of the muck,

577
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:49,144
consoling itself with its great beauty.

578
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:57,754
I have come to think of so much
of consciousness as a burden,

579
00:50:57,755 --> 00:51:02,257
a weight, and we have
spared them that.

580
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,530
Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt.

581
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:10,567
The hosts are the ones who are free.

582
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:16,171
Free here under my control.

583
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:23,345
But he's not under your control.

584
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:29,886
He brought me here to show me this.

585
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:33,488
No. He brought you here
because I asked him to.

586
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:42,497
He's been very loyal for many years.

587
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:49,072
Your time running this place

588
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:52,242
like your insane little kingdom

589
00:51:52,243 --> 00:51:53,808
is over.

590
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,080
You've been playing God for long enough.

591
00:51:57,081 --> 00:52:00,283
I simply wanted to tell my stories.

592
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,919
It was you people who wanted to play God

593
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,721
with your little undertaking.

594
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:09,153
Do you really think the
board will stand for this?

595
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,734
The board will do nothing.

596
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:20,537
Our arrangement is too valuable to them.

597
00:52:20,538 --> 00:52:22,005
They test me every now and then.

598
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:24,908
I think they enjoy the sport of it.

599
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,609
This time, they sent you.

600
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:36,186
Sadly, in order to restore things,

601
00:52:36,187 --> 00:52:38,922
the situation demands

602
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:42,691
a blood sacrifice.

603
00:52:45,463 --> 00:52:49,899
See, Arnold and I designed
every part of this place.

604
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,469
It was our dream.

605
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,903
Did you really think

606
00:52:53,904 --> 00:52:58,740
I would let you take it from me?

607
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:06,114
This is what happened to Arnold?

608
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:10,954
Did you have Bernard take
him out into the woods?

609
00:53:10,955 --> 00:53:12,889
No, he wasn't here in those days.

610
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,421
Were you, Bernard?

611
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,618
Like I said,

612
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:45,754
I built all of this.

613
00:53:48,993 --> 00:53:51,928
I'm afraid our guest has grown weary.

614
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:54,195
Perhaps you can help her, Bernard.

615
00:54:06,944 --> 00:54:08,211
No.

616
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:12,614
"And in that sleep,
what dreams may come."

617
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:16,452
Bernard.

618
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:18,354
No. No!

619
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,257
Please! Please!

620
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:23,625
No!

621
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:56,725
We should be getting back, Bernard.

622
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,929
We have a great deal of work to do

623
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,497
on the new storylines.
