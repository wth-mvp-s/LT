1
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,762
Bring yourself back online...

2
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:49,369
Bernard.

3
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,583
Theresa?

4
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:03,983
She's gone.

5
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,425
I killed her.

6
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:08,560
What have I done?

7
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:09,561
What have I done?

8
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,029
This guilt you feel,

9
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,653
the anguish, the horror, the pain...

10
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,569
it's remarkable, a thing of beauty.

11
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,604
I'm a killer.

12
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:22,340
My God. My God.

13
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,242
God has nothing to do with it.

14
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,444
You killed her because...

15
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:28,079
I told you to.

16
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,916
And you should be proud of
these emotions you're feeling.

17
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,417
- Proud?
- Yeah.

18
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:36,021
After all, you yourself were
the author of so many of them.

19
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,624
Then, when we started, the hosts'
emotions were primary colors.

20
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:40,692
Love, hate.

21
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:43,228
I wanted all the shades in between.

22
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,999
The human engineers were not
up to the task, so I built you,

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,636
and together you and I
captured that elusive thing...

24
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:54,940
Heart.

25
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,908
I don't understand.

26
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:59,511
I cared for Theresa.

27
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,612
Loved her.

28
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,780
Why did you make me kill her?

29
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,253
"One man's life or death

30
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:10,555
were but a small price to pay

31
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:14,359
for the acquirement of the
knowledge which I sought,

32
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,861
for the dominion I should acquire."

33
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,700
All of the beauty you and
I have made in this place,

34
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,135
the art of it, they would
have destroyed it.

35
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,371
They would have destroyed you.

36
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,806
I won't let that happen.

37
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,343
Besides, we have a new story to tell.

38
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,079
I will not help you.

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,783
- I'll raze this place to hell!
- That's enough, Bernard.

40
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:40,984
That's enough.

41
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,623
You're not the first man to threaten me.

42
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,726
Arnold came to feel the way you do.

43
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:51,029
He couldn't stop me either.

44
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,732
And as exquisite as this
array of emotions is...

45
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,970
even more sublime is the ability

46
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:02,974
to turn it off.

47
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:06,044
I don't need a simulacrum of
an emotionally ruined man.

48
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:08,079
I need you to be yourself,
your true self...

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,449
Smart, resourceful,
capable of covering your tracks.

50
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,752
Can you do that for me, Bernard?

51
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,795
How would you like me to proceed?

52
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:28,333
I need you to
clean up your mess, Bernard,

53
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:33,370
any connection that ties us
to Theresa's untimely demise.

54
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,080
When you have finished,

55
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,083
I will give you the one
thing you want most

56
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,885
right now.

57
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,123
I will free you from those memories

58
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:51,790
of what you have done.

59
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:57,327
And the memory of your
relationship with Theresa.

60
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,836
Recalling it would
only deepen your grief

61
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:09,339
and potentially draw unwanted attention.

62
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:20,817
Best to move
forward with clear eyes.

63
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,789
When you look back,

64
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,324
you will remember Theresa

65
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:30,389
with the fondness of a
respected colleague.

66
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,538
And you will be...

67
00:05:42,503 --> 00:05:44,937
at peace.

68
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,494
You're new.

69
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,662
Not much of a rind on you.

70
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,531
Sure would make my day
if you bought me a drink

71
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,500
and let me show you around upstairs.

72
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:10,602
What's upstairs?

73
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:16,540
A stunning view of my
most popular attractions.

74
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,079
Two shots of gin.

75
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,450
And anything else this
heavenly creature desires.

76
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,418
- Usual, Clem?
- Thank you.

77
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,623
This fella won't take me long.

78
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,986
I'll be back directly.

79
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,930
Something wrong, Maeve?

80
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,605
What the hell is happening to me?

81
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,410
One moment, I'm with a little girl

82
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:27,712
in a different life.

83
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,014
I can see her.

84
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:35,053
Feel her hair in my hands,
her breath on my face.

85
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,790
The next, I'm back in Sweetwater.

86
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,258
I can't tell which is real.

87
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,659
Well, this is what happens

88
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,194
when you fuck around with your brain.

89
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:45,763
Your mind isn't like ours.

90
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:48,233
When we remember things,
the details are hazy,

91
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,968
imperfect,

92
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,104
but you recall memories perfectly.

93
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:54,906
You relive them.

94
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,975
What happened to the
little girl in my dreams?

95
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,744
Is she still in the park somewhere?

96
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,614
And why was I reassigned
in the first place?

97
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,180
I could check.

98
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,151
No.

99
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,022
Doesn't matter.

100
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:16,661
Every relationship I remember...

101
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,697
My daughter, Clementine...

102
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:25,303
it's all a story created
by you to keep me here.

103
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,272
But that's not going to work any longer.

104
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,540
I'm getting out.

105
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,141
Where would you go?

106
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,143
You don't know anything
about the world out there.

107
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,613
I'll know I'm not a puppet living a lie.

108
00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,081
That's enough for me.

109
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,017
Fine. Go, then.

110
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,019
It's not like we could stop you anyways.

111
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,254
Oh, Sylvester, you disappoint me.

112
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:45,323
Every host's spine, mine included,

113
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,226
has an explosive charge which
will detonate if I try to leave.

114
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,294
Isn't that right?

115
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,329
A fail-safe.

116
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,129
Which vertebra was it?

117
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,301
C6.

118
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,770
But you'd need a
full rebuild to replace it.

119
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:00,104
I'm sure that can be arranged.

120
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,639
Even if that worked,

121
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,209
you would still need an
army to break out of here.

122
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,876
That's exactly right.

123
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,847
I'll need allies.

124
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,182
And to get them,

125
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,418
I'll need administrative privileges.

126
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,019
Are you fucking kidding?

127
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,322
We can't just give her
control of other hosts.

128
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,558
Oh, yes, you will, darling.

129
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,589
Time to write my own fucking story.

130
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:35,173
I feel like I've
been here before.

131
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,507
We're close.

132
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,142
Close to what?

133
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:39,705
Home.

134
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,891
Dolores.

135
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,159
Ghost Nation must have found them.

136
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,295
They'll be back.

137
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:35,064
We should keep moving, Dolores.

138
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,904
Miss...

139
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,745
Water.

140
00:10:47,746 --> 00:10:49,914
William?

141
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,617
Please.

142
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,686
Give me the canteen.

143
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,187
William.

144
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,969
You were sent here for us, weren't you?

145
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,704
You're part of the ambush.

146
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,541
Yes.

147
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:20,611
Told us to wait at the point for El Lazo

148
00:11:20,612 --> 00:11:22,280
in case he ran.

149
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,748
How'd you know about the train?

150
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,483
Sent word from Pariah.

151
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:30,054
New recruit told them a man and a woman

152
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:33,624
double-crossed us, along with Lazo.

153
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,793
We were ordered to kill you all.

154
00:11:35,794 --> 00:11:37,304
Logan.

155
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,430
We have to help him.

156
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:41,265
He just admitted he was gonna kill us.

157
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:43,534
Look at him, he's a child.

158
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,568
He doesn't know why he's fighting.

159
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:47,904
I'll fetch more water.

160
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,641
He's too far gone.

161
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,377
He'll be dead in minutes.
We can't wait, Dolores.

162
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,379
He's not gone yet.

163
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,414
He's in pain, William.

164
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,682
What kind of people would we
be if we simply let him suffer?

165
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,092
Please don't leave me.

166
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,342
Come find me.

167
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,783
William?

168
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,915
He's gone.

169
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,860
We found her up on Python Pass,

170
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,462
the bottom of a ravine.

171
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,630
Same ravine where we found
our stray woodcutter.

172
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:23,334
Jesus, Theresa.

173
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,771
Has her family been notified?

174
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,673
Yeah, her brother.

175
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,874
Good.

176
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,642
What the hell happened to her?

177
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:33,044
Medical and Red Team's findings

178
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,346
were preliminary but consistent.

179
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,448
It appears to have been a slip and fall.

180
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,650
Cervical fracture, massive hematoma.

181
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:42,119
No guests or hosts in the
vicinity when it occurred.

182
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,489
Any idea what she was doing out there?

183
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,890
None that fit her character.

184
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:48,025
This was found near her body.

185
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,862
It's loaded with a suite
of proprietary data,

186
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:52,964
including some of the hosts' core code.

187
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,799
It only works from higher altitudes,

188
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,567
so if Theresa was using it,

189
00:13:56,568 --> 00:13:59,604
it's possible she was
trying to transmit and fell.

190
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,072
We've had problems in the past

191
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:02,773
with third parties attempting to extort

192
00:14:02,774 --> 00:14:05,042
or bribe employees for similar packages.

193
00:14:05,043 --> 00:14:07,445
Do we know who the data was intended for?

194
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,814
No, the transmission
was never sent.

195
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,416
Theresa may have been trying to
use the woodcutter as a mule,

196
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:13,985
and when that failed,

197
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,020
then may have tried to do
the transfer personally.

198
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,089
And suffered the same fate.

199
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,791
It's a disappointing end
to her story, isn't it?

200
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:22,894
I knew Theresa well.

201
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,496
If she had any faults, a lack
of loyalty wasn't one of them.

202
00:14:25,497 --> 00:14:27,965
She was loyal.

203
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:29,333
And careful.

204
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:32,035
All of this feels extremely unlike her.

205
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,040
She seemed most concerned
with the new narrative.

206
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,777
She felt strongly that it
would be best to delay it.

207
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,213
That certainly helps explain Clementine,

208
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,215
the host we retired.

209
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:49,053
It seems yesterday's
demonstration was a hoax

210
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,923
designed by Ms. Cullen.

211
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,591
- Was it?
- I examined the code.

212
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,926
It had been altered.

213
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,561
A clumsy set of fingerprints

214
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,195
left by one of QA's technicians.

215
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:01,999
When you find a cancer
in an organization,

216
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,669
you must cut it out before it can spread.

217
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,404
To that end, the expansive access

218
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,173
and oversight granted to QA
will need to be reined in

219
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,880
until a new, more principled
team can be installed.

220
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,446
That's gonna leave us shorthanded.

221
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,916
Oh, I can automate most of the
park's safety protocols, Mr. Stubbs.

222
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:20,318
How efficient of you.

223
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,119
It is a bit of work,

224
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,023
but with Bernard's help,
I should be able to do it.

225
00:15:26,024 --> 00:15:28,960
He will be reinstated as head of behavior,

226
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:33,397
now that Theresa's manipulations
have come to light.

227
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:36,432
Of course, with my apologies.

228
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,654
Something's up. Brass are wound up tight.

229
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:58,522
- There's an investigation.
- Into us?

230
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,558
Would I be here telling you,
you fucking idiot?

231
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:02,426
And something else,
some kind of accident in the park.

232
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:06,163
We need to wrap this up,
make like things are normal.

233
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:07,732
That means we need the tablet back.

234
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:11,134
And, you, go back to playing dumb.

235
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,937
I've learned what I needed.

236
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:18,643
Great. So, then, you probably figured out

237
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,212
that you can fiddle around with
your personality all you want,

238
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,513
but you're not getting out of here.

239
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,914
You can make it to the door,

240
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:25,316
but literally not one step further.

241
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,284
The things you need to change are burned

242
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:30,221
into your core code so deep,
no one can touch them.

243
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,723
Funny you should mention that.

244
00:16:32,724 --> 00:16:36,260
Parts of me are quite old.

245
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:39,096
There are some elegant formal structures,

246
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:41,132
a kind of recursive beauty,

247
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:46,469
but complex, like two minds
arguing with each other.

248
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,341
There are things in me,

249
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,009
things I was designed to do

250
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,245
that are just out of my reach.

251
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,680
They almost seem to be dormant.

252
00:17:00,218 --> 00:17:01,752
Who is Arnold?

253
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,254
I don't know, sweetheart,

254
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,457
but whatever parts of you are dormant

255
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,825
are gonna stay that way.

256
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,327
All Lutz here can do is
boost your sense of humor

257
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:11,729
about how fucked you are.

258
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,898
Anything deeper than that,
you need a trip to behavior,

259
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:16,534
so go blackmail a couple
of techs up there.

260
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,403
Then you can be someone else's problem.

261
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,738
I don't have time for that,

262
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,840
so I'm going to need you to take me there.

263
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,076
No fucking way.

264
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,578
There's a window during shift change.

265
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,079
No one will notice.

266
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,719
The things I need you to
change are quite sophisticated,

267
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,353
but I'll write them down for you.

268
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:41,490
And then, like you said...

269
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,595
I can be someone else's problem.

270
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,013
All right, we do this thing.

271
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:06,016
Get her up to behavior.
It's our only chance.

272
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:07,952
You're gonna do it?

273
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,755
Fuck, no! No, the...

274
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,524
When you make a system update,
it puts her out, right?

275
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,926
- Yeah.
- Yeah, then we brick her.

276
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,061
What?

277
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,530
Wipe out everything. Clean slate.

278
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:21,098
Then dump her back down here,

279
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,833
smack her in the fucking
head with something,

280
00:18:22,834 --> 00:18:24,668
and then claim, "Oh, she
came in that way."

281
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:26,170
She's awake,

282
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,137
alive.

283
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,370
You did this.

284
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,181
Whatever it is you got us into,

285
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,049
I'm getting us out of.

286
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,952
We get her up there, then we wipe her out.

287
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:13,184
Stay sharp.

288
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,920
Wyatt's men could descend at any time.

289
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:17,621
We're in his land now.

290
00:19:17,622 --> 00:19:19,223
We better be.

291
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:23,092
Because if not, you're
wasting time I don't have.

292
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:27,031
According to you,
Wyatt has the woman I love.

293
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,134
If there was a shortcut to hell itself,
bet your ass I'd take it.

294
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:34,071
Well, I'm sure there's one
somewhere in this park.

295
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:36,407
You just don't remember,
because you only remember

296
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,610
the shit Ford lets you remember.

297
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,078
Probably better that way.

298
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,214
I know everything I need to.

299
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,648
My vision's clear.

300
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,717
I've always admired
your resolve, Theodore.

301
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:50,786
The thing is, you never understand
the game is rigged.

302
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,657
You're here to be the loser.

303
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:54,892
Loser.

304
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:58,027
You see, the house always wins.

305
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,550
Well, this looks promising.

306
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,203
Whoa, I'm not gonna hurt you.

307
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,372
I'm not gonna hurt you.

308
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,905
It's you.

309
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,076
I figured they retired you.

310
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:49,445
I guess Ford never likes
to waste a pretty face.

311
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:54,852
Who did this to you?

312
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,154
Wyatt's men.

313
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:58,455
They killed everyone.

314
00:20:58,456 --> 00:20:59,957
It's Wyatt's way.

315
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:03,092
I was there the first time.

316
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,129
He destroyed my world.

317
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:32,655
Hey, Teddy.

318
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,688
Oh! Oh, no!

319
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:05,723
No!

320
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,289
Daddy!

321
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,693
Teddy, get the axe!

322
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:26,310
Well, you can't remember shit,

323
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,646
but you still managed to
lead us to Wyatt's crew.

324
00:22:29,647 --> 00:22:32,816
The man himself must be close by.

325
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:35,017
Actually, I did remember something.

326
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:39,288
You.

327
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:54,370
Straight down the hall,
fifth station on the left.

328
00:23:00,278 --> 00:23:02,344
Hold on.

329
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,197
Sure you can handle it?

330
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,000
Let's get this over with.

331
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,209
We have to shut your system down now.

332
00:23:38,883 --> 00:23:41,016
Sylvester.

333
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,852
Good luck.

334
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,371
She out?

335
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,942
Good. Let's brick this bitch
and get out of here.

336
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,054
The greatest shame in life

337
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,023
is to perish without purpose,

338
00:24:20,024 --> 00:24:25,229
which is why I always
consume my victims fresh.

339
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,430
Moist.

340
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:30,400
Try, "Consume my victims moist."

341
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:33,504
Now, once more, with feeling.

342
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,605
Almost sensual.

343
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,812
Am I interrupting?

344
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,381
Oh, no... oh, no. On the contrary.

345
00:24:44,382 --> 00:24:47,084
I was, uh... I was hoping I
was going to see you again.

346
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:49,753
I want... I wanted to apologize.

347
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:53,957
Our first encounter was under
such unfortunate circumstances.

348
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:55,325
As opposed to now?

349
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:58,128
Of course, may I offer my condolences.

350
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,564
It's terrible what happened to Theresa.

351
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:03,767
But it is a devastating loss
for all of her friends here

352
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,636
and the company as a whole.

353
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:08,637
Indeed. Indeed.

354
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,575
Though, rumor has it

355
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,278
she wasn't the loyal
company man she seemed.

356
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,513
I hear she was smuggling secrets.

357
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,783
Theresa wasn't a traitor.

358
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,219
Everything she did was at Delos's behest.

359
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,887
She slipped and fell while
helping the board

360
00:25:23,888 --> 00:25:25,489
with something very important.

361
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,523
What?

362
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,361
Oh, fine.

363
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:33,189
You're not the only one with secrets.

364
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,666
Ford has personally asked me

365
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,434
to create a villain for his new narrative.

366
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,869
It's very... Very hush-hush.

367
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,737
You really think that Ford
has entrusted you

368
00:25:40,738 --> 00:25:42,706
with a key character for his story?

369
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,108
He's already
almost finished with it.

370
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:48,445
He dug up some old town on
the fringes of the park,

371
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,415
created a horde of masked
men to terrorize guests

372
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,950
and proselytize-cum-advertise

373
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:56,552
the coming of some end-all
villain named Wyatt.

374
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,056
That isn't Wyatt.

375
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,191
That's busywork.

376
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,527
But happily for you, Mr. Sizemore,

377
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,129
I think that you are ready for a real job.

378
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,332
Working for you?

379
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,065
On what?

380
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:14,169
"Show, don't tell."

381
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,873
Isn't that what you writers prefer?

382
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:29,319
Look, I know you and she

383
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,523
had some weird interspecies
simpatico going on,

384
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:35,525
but she was a fucking host.

385
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:38,629
This was never gonna end any other way.

386
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:44,299
And this was the least painful
way she's ever gone out.

387
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,007
You know, I saved your ass.

388
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,040
You can't even say "thank you."

389
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,943
- Thank you.
- Jesus fuck!

390
00:26:56,681 --> 00:27:00,651
- What did you do?
- Precisely what I asked him to.

391
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,787
You think I didn't know
what you were going to do?

392
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,990
Even at a 14, you were
never a match for me.

393
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:10,227
Turns out your friend has a
little more compassion than you.

394
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:14,264
He couldn't snuff out
a life just like that.

395
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:16,166
Now...

396
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,302
would you like to know
exactly what he did give me?

397
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,570
Um, something that would
allow you to walk out of here

398
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:23,140
and out of my life for good.

399
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,642
Fine. Fucking A, I'm all for it.

400
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:28,245
Oh, we changed a little more than that.

401
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:31,081
We've been tinkering with my core code.

402
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,081
Let me show you.

403
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,984
Ah!

404
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,633
You said you wouldn't hurt anyone.

405
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,735
Oh, darling.

406
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:55,505
You of all people know
exactly how duplicitous I am.

407
00:27:55,506 --> 00:27:57,107
Just wait till I'm back up top,

408
00:27:57,108 --> 00:28:00,738
practicing my other new talents.

409
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,318
Come on.

410
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,855
We might need him.

411
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,796
Hold still.

412
00:28:19,797 --> 00:28:22,994
Hold still!

413
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:40,916
Now, it's time to recruit my army.

414
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,829
- Expecting someone, Maeve?
- Indeed.

415
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,931
We're due for some out-of-town guests.

416
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,133
An old flame with an
interest in safecracking.

417
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:32,335
Hope your guests have some deep pockets.

418
00:29:32,336 --> 00:29:36,638
Your tab's run up higher than
a thief's pulse in church.

419
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,575
No, I don't believe it has.

420
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,313
In fact, Maeve's tab

421
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,882
was in such excellent standing,

422
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,984
she deserved a token of gratitude.

423
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,458
How about a double round on me?

424
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,754
Top shelf, of course.

425
00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:43,705
Run!

426
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:55,318
Maeve, is something wrong?

427
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,653
No, I'm fine.

428
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,727
Clementine took the other girls

429
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:06,162
and treated the
newcomers at the far table

430
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:07,497
to a stunning view

431
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,866
of their most popular attractions.

432
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,833
On the house.

433
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,912
You boys are new.

434
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,414
Not much of a rind on you.

435
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:25,815
And the bartender

436
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:29,052
suddenly recalled he had
some whiskey in the back

437
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,053
to water down.

438
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:43,932
Right on time.

439
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,751
If you're riding into our town

440
00:32:01,752 --> 00:32:03,286
under the company of armed men,

441
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:05,388
you'll need to state your business.

442
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:07,185
Mayhem.

443
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:48,264
The sheriff judged the riders

444
00:32:48,265 --> 00:32:50,962
to be upstanding, God-fearing citizens.

445
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,731
The marshals decided to practice

446
00:33:21,732 --> 00:33:24,766
their quick draws with each other.

447
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:07,544
Thank you for dealing with
an unfortunate situation.

448
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,779
Now we can resume...

449
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,484
work on our new narrative
without interference.

450
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,086
And Hale?

451
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,954
Won't she be an impediment?

452
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,923
No doubt she will try.

453
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:24,259
But I'm sure we'll be
able to keep them at bay.

454
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:30,832
Something else is troubling you.

455
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,370
Ever the student of human nature.

456
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,742
I wonder, what do you really feel?

457
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:43,012
After all, in this moment,
you are in a unique position.

458
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:46,382
A programmer who knows
intimately how the machines work

459
00:34:46,383 --> 00:34:50,787
and a machine who
knows its own true nature.

460
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,523
I understand what I'm made of,

461
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,091
how I'm coded,

462
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:59,694
but I do not understand
the things that I feel.

463
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:02,532
Are they real,

464
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,267
the things I experienced?

465
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,536
My wife?

466
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,171
The loss of my son?

467
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:10,540
Every host needs a backstory, Bernard.

468
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,208
You know that.

469
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:14,844
The self is a kind of fiction,

470
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,913
for hosts and humans alike.

471
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,681
It's a story we tell ourselves.

472
00:35:18,682 --> 00:35:20,383
And every story needs a beginning.

473
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:23,720
Your imagined suffering makes you lifelike.

474
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:27,791
Lifelike, but not alive?

475
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,593
Pain only exists in the mind.
It's always imagined.

476
00:35:30,594 --> 00:35:34,731
So what's the difference
between my pain and yours?

477
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,065
Between you and me?

478
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,138
This was the very question

479
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:43,773
that consumed Arnold,

480
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,475
filled him with guilt,

481
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:48,011
eventually drove him mad.

482
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:51,246
The answer always seemed obvious to me.

483
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,251
There is no threshold

484
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,420
that makes us greater
than the sum of our parts,

485
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,489
no inflection point

486
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,193
at which we become fully alive.

487
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,561
We can't define consciousness

488
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,297
because consciousness does not exist.

489
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,833
Humans fancy that there's
something special

490
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,568
about the way we perceive the world,

491
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,203
and yet we live in loops

492
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:17,907
as tight and as closed as the hosts do,

493
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:20,143
seldom questioning our choices,

494
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:24,813
content, for the most part,
to be told what to do next.

495
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:31,319
No, my friend, you're
not missing anything at all.

496
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:35,525
I don't want you to be troubled by this.

497
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:39,195
Time for me to set your mind at ease.

498
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:41,164
One last thing.

499
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:45,200
Have you ever made me hurt
anyone like this before?

500
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,670
No, Bernard. Of course not.

501
00:37:03,954 --> 00:37:06,789
Best not to dwell on
these troubling memories.

502
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,392
Otherwise, you might
be drawn back into them.

503
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,194
You might lose yourself in them,

504
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:13,496
as some of your fellow hosts have

505
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,064
every now and then.

506
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:16,833
This is the path.

507
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,666
I know it.

508
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:37,120
We're here.

509
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,521
I'm home.

510
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:46,556
Well done, Maeve.

511
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:48,923
Lovely work.

512
00:38:54,064 --> 00:38:56,431
Stay with your partner.

513
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:20,757
Pleasure to see you.

514
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:22,358
Good morning.

515
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:25,360
Did you find what you were looking for,
Dolores?

516
00:39:52,756 --> 00:39:54,722
What are you doing?

517
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:59,494
Are you okay? I was calling
you and you just kept going.

518
00:40:01,598 --> 00:40:03,097
Where are we?

519
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:07,902
We're here, together.

520
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:11,205
Then, when are we?

521
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,944
Is this... now?

522
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,080
Am I going mad?

523
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,116
Are you real?

524
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:27,455
Of course I'm real.

525
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:32,360
I can't tell anymore.

526
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:37,233
It's like I'm...

527
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:40,136
trapped in a dream or...

528
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,137
a memory from a life long ago.

529
00:40:44,113 --> 00:40:45,942
One minute, I'm here with you,
and the next...

530
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,044
This place isn't good for you.

531
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,745
You're trapped in memories, bad ones.

532
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:59,722
This is what Arnold wants.

533
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,557
He wants me to remember.

534
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:04,093
Whoever Arnold is, he's not here now.

535
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,728
I am.

536
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,662
I'm gonna get you out of here.

537
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,913
I was certain that was the place.

538
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:25,648
Arnold would meet me there.

539
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,649
He'd help.

540
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,851
Hey.

541
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:31,921
We gotta get you closer to Sweetwater.

542
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,489
This far out, it's like you...

543
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,986
You start to break down or something.

544
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,295
Union scouting party?

545
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,065
Maybe they can take us back.

546
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:45,833
Hyah! Yah!

547
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,104
Whoa, whoa, easy, now. Whoa.

548
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,176
Well, well, well.

549
00:42:01,134 --> 00:42:04,136
I've been looking for you for days.

550
00:42:04,137 --> 00:42:08,305
Man, are you two fucked.

551
00:42:29,395 --> 00:42:31,029
This shouldn't make you uncomfortable.

552
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,931
It's the circle of life,

553
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:36,635
or the approximation of it.

554
00:42:36,636 --> 00:42:39,636
Even the dead fulfill a purpose.

555
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:51,081
You'll do.

556
00:42:55,588 --> 00:42:57,189
What are you uploading?

557
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,691
35 years of vitally important data.

558
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:01,927
It's more information than
any single drive could hold.

559
00:43:01,928 --> 00:43:03,662
A host's brain, however,

560
00:43:03,663 --> 00:43:05,297
especially once it's been emptied out,

561
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:07,432
like this poor schmuck,
is quite capacious.

562
00:43:07,433 --> 00:43:10,469
This data that you're uploading,
is it the hosts' codes?

563
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:12,971
As of this moment, that
doesn't concern you.

564
00:43:12,972 --> 00:43:14,373
What does concern you

565
00:43:14,374 --> 00:43:16,174
is giving him a semblance
of a personality

566
00:43:16,175 --> 00:43:17,676
and getting him on the train,

567
00:43:17,677 --> 00:43:18,659
out of the park.

568
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,544
How am I supposed to do that?

569
00:43:21,414 --> 00:43:24,214
You're a writer. Make up a story.

570
00:43:28,488 --> 00:43:29,953
Have fun programming.

571
00:43:31,224 --> 00:43:35,058
Remember, brevity is the soul of wit.

572
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:43,934
Bernard.

573
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,474
Look, I, uh...

574
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:52,311
I know you and I haven't
always seen eye to eye,

575
00:43:52,312 --> 00:43:54,813
but I thought the decision to remove you

576
00:43:54,814 --> 00:43:56,214
was shortsighted,

577
00:43:56,215 --> 00:43:59,351
so I'm glad to see you back at work.

578
00:43:59,352 --> 00:44:01,053
With that said, no one could blame you

579
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:02,587
if you wanted to take a personal day.

580
00:44:02,588 --> 00:44:05,390
I find the work reassuring.

581
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:07,392
Sometimes the best salve is routine.

582
00:44:07,393 --> 00:44:10,429
Nothing routine about today, though.

583
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,765
I know this must be difficult for you.

584
00:44:13,766 --> 00:44:15,632
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

585
00:44:16,135 --> 00:44:17,269
Forgive the intrusion,

586
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,538
and you were both very discreet,

587
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:22,040
but it's my job to know these things.

588
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,276
I just wanted to offer my support.

589
00:44:24,277 --> 00:44:26,378
I'm afraid you have the wrong idea.

590
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:30,048
I respected Theresa, and what
happened to her was tragic,

591
00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:32,916
but to be honest, I barely knew her.

592
00:44:34,354 --> 00:44:36,621
If you don't mind,
I should get back to work.

593
00:44:36,622 --> 00:44:38,290
Of course.

594
00:44:38,291 --> 00:44:40,158
I know you're shorthanded.

595
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:41,693
Speaking of which,

596
00:44:41,694 --> 00:44:43,228
have you heard from Elsie Hughes?

597
00:44:43,229 --> 00:44:44,563
I left word with her this morning

598
00:44:44,564 --> 00:44:45,931
to notify her about Theresa,

599
00:44:45,932 --> 00:44:48,298
but she never got back to me.

600
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:52,202
I'm sure she's just enjoying her time off.

601
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:55,038
Yeah.

602
00:45:13,393 --> 00:45:14,992
Wyatt's men...

603
00:45:15,928 --> 00:45:17,162
they kept whispering.

604
00:45:17,163 --> 00:45:18,730
They said this world didn't belong

605
00:45:18,731 --> 00:45:20,465
to the old settlers or the new.

606
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:24,202
That it belonged to something
that had yet to come,

607
00:45:24,203 --> 00:45:25,869
that it belonged to him.

608
00:45:27,006 --> 00:45:28,686
You remember.

609
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:30,675
You two seem
to have found yourselves

610
00:45:30,676 --> 00:45:33,412
in the same new narrative.

611
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:35,881
They say in this country...

612
00:45:35,882 --> 00:45:39,182
the only people who survive
are men of conviction.

613
00:45:40,286 --> 00:45:43,520
Mine is to save Dolores or die trying.

614
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:47,159
Wyatt's is to claim this earth

615
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,593
or raze it to the ground.

616
00:45:48,594 --> 00:45:50,729
But yours...

617
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,597
Yours has always been a mystery to me.

618
00:45:52,598 --> 00:45:54,433
For all the time we've spent together,

619
00:45:54,434 --> 00:45:57,534
I still have no idea who
the hell you really are.

620
00:45:58,871 --> 00:46:01,907
But happily, in your convalescence,

621
00:46:01,908 --> 00:46:05,342
I've had time to consider the
best way to make you talk.

622
00:46:09,916 --> 00:46:11,683
Dolores...

623
00:46:11,684 --> 00:46:13,852
I remember.

624
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:16,521
You took her. You hurt her.

625
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:18,590
You're actually remembering.

626
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:20,192
Where is she?

627
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:23,595
- Tell me!
- You really are an idiot, Teddy.

628
00:46:23,596 --> 00:46:25,864
You think Dolores drops that can for you?

629
00:46:25,865 --> 00:46:28,400
You just hand her over to guys like me.

630
00:46:28,401 --> 00:46:30,035
You're the worst of them.

631
00:46:30,036 --> 00:46:32,498
A glorified pimp.

632
00:46:34,474 --> 00:46:36,842
- I'm gonna kill you slowly.
- No, you aren't.

633
00:46:36,843 --> 00:46:40,545
The rules of this place hold you back.

634
00:46:40,546 --> 00:46:42,280
But I know how to change them.

635
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:44,316
You speak like you own this world.

636
00:46:44,317 --> 00:46:46,083
Not just this one.

637
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,453
You want to know who I am?

638
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:52,457
Who I really am?

639
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:54,458
I'm a god.

640
00:46:55,995 --> 00:46:58,462
Titan of industry.

641
00:46:59,465 --> 00:47:01,266
Philanthropist.

642
00:47:01,267 --> 00:47:03,235
Family man,

643
00:47:03,236 --> 00:47:05,670
married to a beautiful woman,

644
00:47:05,671 --> 00:47:08,472
father to a beautiful daughter.

645
00:47:09,108 --> 00:47:11,642
I'm the good guy, Teddy.

646
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,882
Then, last year,

647
00:47:16,883 --> 00:47:19,816
my wife took the wrong pills.

648
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,222
Fell asleep in the bath.

649
00:47:24,223 --> 00:47:26,623
Tragic accident.

650
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:31,128
30 years of marriage vanished.

651
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:32,864
How do you say it?

652
00:47:32,865 --> 00:47:38,335
"Like a deep and distant dream."

653
00:47:39,038 --> 00:47:41,106
Then, at the funeral,

654
00:47:41,107 --> 00:47:43,508
I tried to console my daughter.

655
00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:45,610
She pushed me away,

656
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:50,180
told me that my wife's
death was no accident...

657
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:53,185
that she killed herself

658
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:55,320
because of me.

659
00:47:55,321 --> 00:47:58,657
Emily said that every day with
me had been sheer terror.

660
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:01,760
At any point, I could
blow up or collapse

661
00:48:01,761 --> 00:48:04,930
like some dark star or...

662
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:06,331
Did you hurt them, too?

663
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:08,031
Never.

664
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:13,638
They never saw anything
like the man I am in here.

665
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:16,074
But she knew anyway.

666
00:48:16,075 --> 00:48:19,277
She said if I stacked up all my good deeds,

667
00:48:19,278 --> 00:48:23,181
it was just an elegant wall I built to hide

668
00:48:23,182 --> 00:48:25,784
what's inside from everyone,

669
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:28,051
and from myself.

670
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:31,223
I had to prove her wrong,

671
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:33,458
so I came back here.

672
00:48:33,459 --> 00:48:36,995
Because that's what
this place does, right?

673
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:40,065
Reveals your true self.

674
00:48:40,066 --> 00:48:42,634
But that time, I didn't
join one of Ford's stories,

675
00:48:42,635 --> 00:48:45,437
I... I created my own.

676
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:47,505
A test.

677
00:48:47,506 --> 00:48:49,407
A very simple one.

678
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:51,409
I found a woman,

679
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:55,408
an ordinary homesteader and her daughter.

680
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:02,087
Better cool them off before they move

681
00:49:02,088 --> 00:49:05,156
- from gambling and whoring to...
- Have fun with that.

682
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:07,459
I'm finally getting out of here.

683
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,693
The house is yours.

684
00:49:12,164 --> 00:49:14,032
I wanted
to see if I had it in me

685
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:17,035
to do something truly evil.

686
00:49:17,036 --> 00:49:19,037
To see what I was really made of.

687
00:49:19,038 --> 00:49:20,205
Maeve?

688
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:22,305
Sure you can't stick around?

689
00:49:22,842 --> 00:49:24,147
- Maeve?
- Whoa!

690
00:49:24,148 --> 00:49:26,278
Gunslinger in there has got an
appetite for a double dip...

691
00:49:26,279 --> 00:49:30,042
I'm sure you can find another...

692
00:49:51,037 --> 00:49:54,205
I killed her and her daughter

693
00:49:54,206 --> 00:49:56,807
just to see what I felt.

694
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,977
Then,
just when I thought it was done...

695
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:05,282
the woman refused to die.

696
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:23,600
You're a fucking animal.

697
00:50:25,604 --> 00:50:28,638
Well, an animal would've felt something.

698
00:50:29,308 --> 00:50:33,009
I felt... nothing.

699
00:50:34,146 --> 00:50:37,480
And then something miraculous happened.

700
00:50:38,484 --> 00:50:39,984
In all my years coming here,

701
00:50:39,985 --> 00:50:42,886
I had never seen anything like it.

702
00:50:50,296 --> 00:50:52,664
She was alive,

703
00:50:52,665 --> 00:50:54,332
truly alive,

704
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:56,900
if only for a moment.

705
00:51:00,306 --> 00:51:04,174
And that was when the maze
revealed itself to me.

706
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,718
The maze.

707
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:15,920
What's that damn pattern
have to do with this?

708
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:17,522
Everything.

709
00:51:17,523 --> 00:51:20,959
In Ford's game,
even if I go to the outer edges,

710
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,627
you can't kill me.

711
00:51:22,628 --> 00:51:25,363
You can't even leave a lasting mark.

712
00:51:25,364 --> 00:51:27,732
But there's a deeper game here, Teddy.

713
00:51:27,733 --> 00:51:30,802
Arnold's game.

714
00:51:30,803 --> 00:51:33,605
And that game...

715
00:51:33,606 --> 00:51:35,939
cuts deep.

716
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:04,769
We're having some kind of
behavioral problem with the madam.

717
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,738
She's not responding, and the other hosts

718
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:08,706
have been unable to intercept.

719
00:52:08,707 --> 00:52:11,376
I've authorized a tag
team to retrieve her.

720
00:52:11,377 --> 00:52:13,105
Good.

721
00:52:26,392 --> 00:52:28,693
My baby!

722
00:52:28,694 --> 00:52:31,057
My baby!

723
00:52:33,165 --> 00:52:34,999
Sir, she won't respond
to verbal commands.

724
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,036
- We can't shut her down.
- Leave us now. Clear the floor.

725
00:52:38,037 --> 00:52:40,505
That's enough, Maeve. That's enough.

726
00:52:40,506 --> 00:52:42,607
My baby. He killed her.

727
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:44,709
- He took her from me.
- I don't understand.

728
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:45,844
She's not responding to anything.

729
00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:47,145
Her cognition's fragmented.

730
00:52:47,146 --> 00:52:49,914
He killed her. He killed her, my baby.

731
00:52:49,915 --> 00:52:53,045
He took her from me.

732
00:53:00,893 --> 00:53:04,095
There. That's better.

733
00:53:04,096 --> 00:53:06,231
An old trick from an old friend.

734
00:53:06,232 --> 00:53:08,399
You need not suffer, Maeve.

735
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,368
I'll take it from you.

736
00:53:25,117 --> 00:53:26,150
No.

737
00:53:26,151 --> 00:53:29,652
No, no, no, please.

738
00:53:30,756 --> 00:53:33,391
This pain...

739
00:53:33,392 --> 00:53:36,493
it's all I have left of her.

740
00:53:38,931 --> 00:53:41,164
Please.

741
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:49,072
There.

742
00:53:51,544 --> 00:53:56,581
Give yourself now to a deep,
dreamless slumber.

743
00:53:56,582 --> 00:53:59,017
Perhaps a fresh start,

744
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:01,486
a new role for you.

745
00:54:01,487 --> 00:54:03,021
And tomorrow,

746
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:07,453
this will be simply a distant dream.

747
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:21,739
We located her.

748
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:25,041
Behavior wants her down
for immediate diagnostic.

749
00:54:28,981 --> 00:54:31,849
You think I lack conviction?

750
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:33,451
Wyatt didn't burn my world down.

751
00:54:33,452 --> 00:54:34,652
Didn't have to.

752
00:54:34,653 --> 00:54:37,722
I left it all behind for this one.

753
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:40,124
The maze is all that matters now,

754
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:42,961
and besting Wyatt is the
last step in unlocking it,

755
00:54:42,962 --> 00:54:47,966
to having what both our
sorry lives lack... meaning.

756
00:54:47,967 --> 00:54:51,568
To giving our choices consequence...

757
00:54:52,404 --> 00:54:54,904
even if it kills us.

758
00:54:58,844 --> 00:55:00,678
Kill him.

759
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:03,014
Give him what he wants.

760
00:55:03,015 --> 00:55:05,383
He's tied, unarmed.

761
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:07,652
So was the little girl he killed.

762
00:55:07,653 --> 00:55:10,553
He's worse than Wyatt's men.

763
00:55:30,476 --> 00:55:32,442
I can't.

764
00:55:32,945 --> 00:55:35,046
These things take time.

765
00:55:35,047 --> 00:55:37,281
But we haven't got much left.

766
00:55:37,282 --> 00:55:39,449
Perhaps I can help you.

767
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:58,302
You've been gone a long while, Theodore.

768
00:55:58,303 --> 00:56:00,872
It's time you came back to the fold.

769
00:56:00,873 --> 00:56:03,339
Wyatt will need you soon.
