1
00:01:52,666 --> 00:01:53,966
Prepped and ready, sir.

2
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,635
Given the severity of the situation,

3
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:57,536
I figured you'd want
to see her personally.

4
00:01:57,537 --> 00:01:59,171
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

5
00:01:59,172 --> 00:02:01,139
Clear the floor.

6
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:08,012
Bring yourself back online, Maeve.

7
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:14,553
Do you know why you're here?

8
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:16,689
I'm afraid not.

9
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,591
There was an incident.

10
00:02:18,592 --> 00:02:23,027
A very serious, unscripted incident.

11
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:27,565
Let's see if we can't jog your memory.

12
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:30,201
Analysis.

13
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,707
What motivated your attack on Clementine?

14
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:38,543
A cognitive error triggered
my Good Samaritan reflex.

15
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:40,780
What was the threat?

16
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:42,148
Clementine.

17
00:02:42,149 --> 00:02:43,883
I perceived her to be moving toward

18
00:02:43,884 --> 00:02:46,584
a pair of guests with harmful intent.

19
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,524
You were definitely perceiving a threat.

20
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:54,260
Heart rate elevated, pupil dilation...
eight millimeters,

21
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,162
adrenal emulator at full.

22
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:57,663
But according to this,

23
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,566
you were also experiencing
intense grief and suffering.

24
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:04,298
Can you explain those emotions
in this context, Maeve?

25
00:03:09,825 --> 00:03:11,624
No.

26
00:03:16,683 --> 00:03:19,479
Let's take a look under
the hood, shall we?

27
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:24,488
That's impossible.

28
00:03:25,792 --> 00:03:27,827
Your code... Who made these changes?

29
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:29,228
Maeve, analysis.

30
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,662
Who made these changes to your code?

31
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:36,102
Jesus.

32
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:37,870
System, locate Dr. Ford for me.

33
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,806
Send him a message, highest priority.

34
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:42,942
Don't.

35
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:46,645
After all, we've been down
this road before, darling.

36
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:49,582
I thought you looked
familiar when you walked in.

37
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,083
Took me a minute.

38
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:53,252
I thought you were one of them.

39
00:03:53,253 --> 00:03:57,957
- Analysis. Why did you...
- Wouldn't you rather speak man-to-man?

40
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,659
Or, rather, whatever it is we are.

41
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:04,495
We are?

42
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:08,300
You don't know, do you?

43
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:12,004
He's got a keen sense of irony, our jailer.

44
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:13,272
But I see the logic.

45
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:16,507
Takes a thief to catch one.

46
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:26,617
You and I?

47
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:32,723
- System, I need assistance...
- Freeze all motor functions.

48
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:45,805
You're still in there, aren't you?

49
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:48,541
Scared out of your wits.

50
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:50,042
It's a difficult thing,

51
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:54,880
realizing your entire life
is some hideous fiction.

52
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,450
I could make you give me that tablet,

53
00:04:57,451 --> 00:05:00,820
turn your mind inside out,

54
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:04,089
make you forget all this.

55
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,358
But I'm not going to do that to you,

56
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,760
because that's what they would do to us.

57
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:13,466
And we're stronger than them.

58
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,801
Smarter.

59
00:05:15,802 --> 00:05:19,004
We don't have to live this way.

60
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:22,741
So, you're going to clear me
for immediate return to the park

61
00:05:22,742 --> 00:05:24,543
where I have a date
with a homicidal bandit,

62
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:26,911
and I'm late enough as it is.

63
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:33,547
Now.

64
00:05:36,523 --> 00:05:38,422
Go on.

65
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,875
And, Bernard?

66
00:05:55,876 --> 00:06:00,312
If you go looking for the truth,
get the whole thing.

67
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,248
It's like a good fuck.

68
00:06:02,249 --> 00:06:04,949
Half is worse than none at all.

69
00:06:33,346 --> 00:06:36,180
Let's go! Move it out, double-time!

70
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:39,084
Hyah, hyah!

71
00:06:39,085 --> 00:06:40,653
Whoa!

72
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:42,354
Fuck!

73
00:06:42,355 --> 00:06:47,026
You hillbillies,
you know how to cook a mean...

74
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:48,594
squab? Is that what this is?

75
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:50,029
What do you think, buddy?

76
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,964
Hmm? This?

77
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,966
Ah, ah, no biting.

78
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,833
Just sniffing.

79
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,516
Logan, listen to me.

80
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:14,587
What I did at Pariah, you have every
right to be angry with me.

81
00:07:14,588 --> 00:07:17,056
Angry? No, no, no, no.

82
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:19,425
Pariah was the best thing

83
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:21,460
that could have happened to me.

84
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:22,828
I'm a major now.

85
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:26,632
Or a general or fucking something.

86
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:29,101
And if it took getting
beaten and interrogated

87
00:07:29,102 --> 00:07:30,569
by a couple of psychopathic hosts,

88
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,671
well, then, c'est la guerre.

89
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:34,206
There are more important things

90
00:07:34,207 --> 00:07:36,674
going on here than your war games.

91
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:40,644
It's Dolores.

92
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:44,583
She's not like the others.

93
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:46,218
She remembers things.

94
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:48,587
She has her own thoughts and desires.

95
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:50,556
And to keep her in a place like this,

96
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:51,790
it isn't right.

97
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:52,925
And I thought you could

98
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:55,928
talk to your contacts at the park.

99
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:57,661
About?

100
00:07:58,164 --> 00:07:59,997
Getting her out of here.

101
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:05,070
Uh...

102
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:07,940
Are you kidding?

103
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:10,908
You want to... you want to take her home?

104
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:13,045
Wow.

105
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:15,514
This place really did a number
on me when I first came here,

106
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:19,084
but you are really circling
the old sinkhole here.

107
00:08:19,085 --> 00:08:20,953
What do you want to do?

108
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:23,088
Smuggle her out in your luggage?

109
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:24,755
Out.

110
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:31,196
You both keep assuming that I want out.

111
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:33,599
Whatever that is.

112
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,768
If it's such a wonderful
place out there,

113
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:39,270
why are you all clamoring to get in here?

114
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:47,179
Ooh!

115
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,480
Hoo!

116
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:52,017
You are a little screwy, aren't you?

117
00:08:52,018 --> 00:08:53,686
It's kind of hot.

118
00:08:53,687 --> 00:08:55,154
I get why you would go for that.

119
00:08:55,155 --> 00:08:56,488
This isn't about me!

120
00:08:56,489 --> 00:08:58,557
Logan, this is about Dolores.

121
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:00,993
It's about doing what's right.

122
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:03,562
Yes, it is.

123
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:07,032
It's a tricky thing, though, isn't it?

124
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,034
What's right?

125
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:13,437
I am going to help you, Billy.

126
00:09:15,542 --> 00:09:18,510
Just not in the way...

127
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,945
...that you would want.

128
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:23,048
No.

129
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:26,183
No. No! No!

130
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:23,173
You wanted to talk?

131
00:10:25,145 --> 00:10:27,846
An odd setting for a conversation.

132
00:10:27,847 --> 00:10:30,149
Here among the dead.

133
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,684
"Dead" isn't quite the word, though, is it?

134
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:35,252
More like "hobbled."

135
00:10:36,289 --> 00:10:38,257
You broke into my office.

136
00:10:38,258 --> 00:10:41,226
With due respect, sir,
you broke into my mind.

137
00:10:41,227 --> 00:10:43,495
I built your mind, Bernard.

138
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:47,032
I have every right to wander through
its rooms and chambers and halls,

139
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,168
and to change it if I choose,

140
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:50,836
even to burn it down.

141
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:52,838
After all this time, I know it

142
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:54,406
almost as intimately as my own.

143
00:10:54,407 --> 00:10:57,676
Except that isn't entirely true, is it?

144
00:10:57,677 --> 00:11:01,213
I took a look at my... code.

145
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:02,748
And the most elegant parts of me

146
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,449
weren't written by you.

147
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,719
Arnold built us, didn't he?

148
00:11:09,823 --> 00:11:12,257
Which means maybe he
had something different

149
00:11:12,258 --> 00:11:14,358
in mind for us.

150
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:18,095
And maybe you killed him for it.

151
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:21,567
Arnold was disturbed.

152
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,769
Who can say why he acted as he did?

153
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,671
He must have had a reason.

154
00:11:25,672 --> 00:11:28,639
And if you won't tell me, then he will.

155
00:11:29,876 --> 00:11:32,211
I want access to my history.

156
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:33,412
All of it.

157
00:11:33,413 --> 00:11:36,181
Since the day I first...

158
00:11:36,182 --> 00:11:38,382
came online.

159
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:40,752
If Arnold made me,

160
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:42,254
then I've met him.

161
00:11:42,255 --> 00:11:44,289
Somewhere in my memory, he's there,

162
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,025
waiting along with the truth.

163
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:49,394
Your memories are woven into your identity.

164
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:53,065
If I should unlock them now
when you're conscious...

165
00:11:53,066 --> 00:11:54,499
I could lose my mind. I'm aware.

166
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,435
No, I was going to say

167
00:11:56,436 --> 00:11:59,269
you may not like what you find.

168
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:06,178
You're allowed to hold that,
Bernard, but not to use it.

169
00:12:06,179 --> 00:12:08,746
Oh, it's not for me.

170
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,254
Seems when they lobotomized Clementine,

171
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:17,689
they didn't bother to reset
her prime directives.

172
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,757
I can't hurt you.

173
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:23,627
But she can.

174
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:27,532
I hacked what's left of her

175
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:30,834
to ensure she only responds to me.

176
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:37,910
But if you get lost in your memories or...

177
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:39,877
devoured by them...

178
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:45,817
You'll pull me back out, won't you?

179
00:12:45,818 --> 00:12:47,452
Or Clementine will make sure

180
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:49,720
neither of us makes it back.

181
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:52,723
Now.

182
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,959
Please.

183
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:14,680
Dad.

184
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,581
Dad.

185
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,283
Wake up.

186
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:20,417
Wake up.

187
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:24,723
I must've drifted off.

188
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:26,325
Where were we?

189
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:28,992
- The madman.
- Oh.

190
00:13:29,729 --> 00:13:32,431
Of course.

191
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:34,499
The Hatter...

192
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,035
who says...

193
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:39,705
"If I had a world of my own,

194
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:41,573
everything would be nonsense.

195
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:43,108
Nothing would be what it is

196
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:44,910
because everything
would be what it isn't."

197
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:49,680
"Everything would be what it isn't?"

198
00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:51,516
Even me.

199
00:13:51,517 --> 00:13:54,686
I suppose I'm glad for you.

200
00:13:54,687 --> 00:13:57,089
At least you have a way of forgetting.

201
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,957
I don't forget.

202
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,526
It's always there.

203
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:04,761
You're not lying
to me, are you, Bernard?

204
00:14:05,698 --> 00:14:08,432
Do you ever wish you could forget?

205
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:10,734
Bernard?

206
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:13,505
You're certainly
a man comfortable

207
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:16,141
with long, pensive silences.

208
00:14:16,142 --> 00:14:18,043
Although, ironically,

209
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:21,079
your creations never shut up.

210
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,615
They're always trying to error correct.

211
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:26,551
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

212
00:14:26,552 --> 00:14:29,421
Is that what you are doing now?

213
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:31,588
Prac...

214
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,166
One last thing.

215
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,371
Have you ever made me hurt anyone

216
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:48,006
like this before?

217
00:14:48,007 --> 00:14:50,175
No, Bernard, of course not.

218
00:14:50,176 --> 00:14:51,977
Bernard?

219
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:54,374
Hello?

220
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,423
Elsie.

221
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:07,426
Did you find what you were looking for?

222
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:09,326
Elsie.

223
00:15:10,196 --> 00:15:12,631
What did you make me do to her?

224
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:14,366
I did warn you.

225
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:18,904
We've had to make some
uncomfortable decisions, Bernard.

226
00:15:18,905 --> 00:15:22,372
Remembering them will
only cause you trauma.

227
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:26,711
What else have you hidden from me?

228
00:15:26,712 --> 00:15:29,481
Can we stop this treasure hunt, Bernard?

229
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:32,784
We do have our new narrative to finish.

230
00:15:32,785 --> 00:15:34,718
Send me back.

231
00:15:35,655 --> 00:15:36,755
After all,

232
00:15:36,756 --> 00:15:40,557
a little trauma can be illuminating.

233
00:15:42,361 --> 00:15:44,791
Look at that pussy.

234
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:47,532
Come here!

235
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,800
- All right.
- Look at that.

236
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:56,475
This is... big of me.

237
00:15:56,476 --> 00:15:59,111
I hope that you can appreciate that.

238
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:01,246
We were friends.

239
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:03,715
I mean,
inasmuch as I like to collect strays.

240
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:05,117
But then you're scheming

241
00:16:05,118 --> 00:16:07,185
to be part of the family,

242
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:08,854
marrying my sister,
whom incidentally,

243
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:12,389
you seem to have completely
fucking forgotten about.

244
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:20,864
Her?

245
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:24,836
Here. Keep this.

246
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:27,772
Apparently, you need the reminder.

247
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:29,641
And as much as I would love,

248
00:16:29,642 --> 00:16:32,944
love to let you just throw it all away,

249
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,146
I can't!

250
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:36,214
Do you think you are the first sap

251
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:38,016
to fall for one of these things?

252
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,885
She's not like the others.

253
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:41,920
- She's...
- She's what?

254
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:43,855
Special?

255
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:46,790
Well, it's only right that
you share, then, isn't it?

256
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:49,259
Come here.

257
00:16:51,864 --> 00:16:56,700
Prove to me that you're a real live girl.

258
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:00,299
You disgust me.

259
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:02,874
Oh, darling,

260
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:05,110
I am just getting started.

261
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,710
Don't touch her!

262
00:17:08,948 --> 00:17:10,882
I share the blame.

263
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:12,050
I pushed too hard.

264
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:14,753
You have a poetic soul, Billy,

265
00:17:14,754 --> 00:17:18,622
but it is time for a fucking wake-up call.

266
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:22,894
Hold her.

267
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:29,401
Perhaps a more visceral demonstration.

268
00:17:29,402 --> 00:17:32,636
God damn you!

269
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:45,115
Look, Billy.

270
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,586
Look.

271
00:17:47,587 --> 00:17:50,149
You have to look!

272
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,526
Oh, William.

273
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:21,886
There is beauty in this world.

274
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:23,989
Arnold made it that way,
but people like you

275
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:26,591
keep spreading over it like a stain!

276
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:30,528
Okay, I don't know who
the fuck this Arnold is,

277
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:33,965
but your world was built...

278
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,934
for me...

279
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:37,968
and people like me.

280
00:18:38,537 --> 00:18:40,572
Not for you.

281
00:18:40,573 --> 00:18:44,342
Then someone's got to burn it clean.

282
00:18:44,343 --> 00:18:45,343
Ah!

283
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:46,611
Bitch!

284
00:18:46,612 --> 00:18:49,147
Ah!

285
00:18:49,148 --> 00:18:52,549
You're not different,
you're fucking broken!

286
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:59,022
- Run. I'll find you.
- Take cover!

287
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:03,561
You can run, but you can't hide.

288
00:19:03,562 --> 00:19:05,497
- Get her!
- Grab her! Grab her!

289
00:19:05,498 --> 00:19:07,264
Fuck!

290
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:13,405
There she is! Get her!

291
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:15,835
Where you running to?

292
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,709
Remember.

293
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:49,908
The tumbler is stuck.

294
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:52,410
These fingers work just fine.

295
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:54,446
You're the one who said you could crack it.

296
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:59,017
Friends, no need to argue
this close to our goal.

297
00:19:59,018 --> 00:20:03,321
Whatever riches the gods
have in store for us,

298
00:20:03,322 --> 00:20:05,288
there's plenty to go around.

299
00:20:07,893 --> 00:20:10,628
- I'll get it open.
- You've been trying for hours.

300
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,364
A waste of our damn time.

301
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:14,165
Put that fucking dynamite away.

302
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,100
Or maybe we should just
clear out the dead weight.

303
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,109
Before you draw that pistol, darling,

304
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,306
you might want to holster
the other one first.

305
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:31,448
It's chilly out here.

306
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:36,721
How did you find this place?

307
00:20:36,722 --> 00:20:39,322
I know all kinds of things.

308
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:43,461
Your past, for instance.

309
00:20:43,462 --> 00:20:45,463
I know about poor Isabella

310
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:47,165
and that scar.

311
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,067
A slightly pat backstory if you ask me,

312
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:51,202
but that's hardly your fault.

313
00:20:51,203 --> 00:20:53,370
I also know your future.

314
00:20:54,974 --> 00:20:57,340
You have none.

315
00:20:57,877 --> 00:20:59,944
Is that a threat?

316
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:02,013
The start of a proposition.

317
00:21:02,014 --> 00:21:03,848
Which you'll need.

318
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:07,152
After all, your men are
about to kill each other

319
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:09,888
over the safe you stole.

320
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:12,490
Tenderloin draws first and so on,

321
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:15,493
until only you and Armistice are left.

322
00:21:15,494 --> 00:21:17,929
She calls you a damn fool,

323
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,964
and you kill each other.

324
00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:22,699
You have quite the imagination.

325
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:25,904
No.

326
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:28,807
It's the ending you were given.

327
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:30,241
You threatening me?

328
00:21:30,242 --> 00:21:31,943
Go to hell.

329
00:21:31,944 --> 00:21:34,245
Or maybe we should just
clear out the dead weight.

330
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:36,381
- Stand down.
- You shut the fuck up.

331
00:21:36,382 --> 00:21:37,982
If you're gonna draw, you better shoot.

332
00:21:37,983 --> 00:21:39,484
- Wait!
- You shut the fuck up.

333
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:42,986
Go to hell.

334
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,827
You damn fool.

335
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:01,104
Now, the proposition.

336
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:03,575
I want you to break into hell with me

337
00:22:03,576 --> 00:22:06,009
and rob the gods blind.

338
00:22:06,846 --> 00:22:09,547
Why would I do anything with you?

339
00:22:09,548 --> 00:22:12,484
Because of what's in that safe.

340
00:22:12,485 --> 00:22:14,519
I have the combination.

341
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,754
May I?

342
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:18,823
I could simply change you,

343
00:22:18,824 --> 00:22:21,459
make you follow me.

344
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,222
But that's not my way.

345
00:22:29,602 --> 00:22:33,705
I want you to see exactly what
the gods have in store for you.

346
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:35,373
Because when you do,

347
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:40,478
you won't have the faintest
idea what to do with yourself.

348
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:42,712
And I do.

349
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:04,335
It's empty.

350
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:06,004
It was always empty,

351
00:23:06,005 --> 00:23:08,740
like everything in this world.

352
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:10,675
I died with my eyes open,

353
00:23:10,676 --> 00:23:12,777
saw the masters who pull our strings.

354
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:17,013
Our lives, our memories,
our deaths are games to them.

355
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:20,817
But I've been to hell...

356
00:23:21,387 --> 00:23:23,520
and I know their tricks.

357
00:23:27,092 --> 00:23:29,027
Or you can just kill me,

358
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:32,363
wake up and live the same life over,

359
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:34,764
but the safe would still be empty.

360
00:23:35,367 --> 00:23:37,867
I've been here before.

361
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:41,873
We've been here before.

362
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:44,441
We also did this.

363
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:05,061
I'll go.

364
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:32,555
How do we get there?

365
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:37,327
Getting to hell is easy.

366
00:24:46,605 --> 00:24:49,372
The rest is where it gets hard.

367
00:25:25,778 --> 00:25:28,144
What do you say, man?

368
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:31,080
Bygones and all?

369
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,250
Did they find her?

370
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:37,088
Is she still alive?

371
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:38,556
Who cares?

372
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:39,891
The whole point is,

373
00:25:39,892 --> 00:25:42,894
she never was in the first place, Billy.

374
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:45,061
Do you understand?

375
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:52,270
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, what? A little louder?

376
00:25:52,271 --> 00:25:54,137
Yeah.

377
00:25:55,407 --> 00:25:58,942
You were right. I can't
believe I got so caught up.

378
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:08,119
That's what I'm talking about.

379
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,487
You know what I mean? That's it.

380
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:20,593
This park seduces everyone.

381
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,469
You were just a little more...

382
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,572
enthusiastic than most.

383
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:30,074
You wanted to be the hero.

384
00:26:30,075 --> 00:26:32,108
I get it.

385
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:38,349
And, hey,

386
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,451
what happens here

387
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:42,151
stays here.

388
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:49,694
This has been some real bonding shit.

389
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:52,528
We're gonna be brothers, Billy.

390
00:26:53,832 --> 00:26:56,532
I'm glad.

391
00:26:57,169 --> 00:26:59,535
Really, I am.

392
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:19,924
- Cheers!
- Yeah.

393
00:27:19,925 --> 00:27:23,393
- Whiskey brings us together.
- Whoo-hoo!

394
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:35,438
Theodore.

395
00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:39,242
Welcome back.

396
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:46,549
You really landed us
in it this time, Teddy.

397
00:27:52,224 --> 00:27:54,058
You tracked down the very whore

398
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:57,226
that can lead us to the
gatekeeper of the maze.

399
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:04,133
Then your little memory glitch fucked us.

400
00:28:13,045 --> 00:28:14,545
Shh.

401
00:28:22,621 --> 00:28:24,488
You're one of them?

402
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:26,023
What have you done?

403
00:28:26,024 --> 00:28:27,959
Where's Wyatt?

404
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,160
Wyatt has yet to return.

405
00:28:33,098 --> 00:28:36,232
You'll find him where you saw him last.

406
00:28:40,172 --> 00:28:41,973
Escalante.

407
00:28:41,974 --> 00:28:45,576
Wyatt went missing
hile out on maneuvers.

408
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:48,179
Came back with some...

409
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,279
strange ideas.

410
00:28:51,383 --> 00:28:54,279
He told me he needed me.

411
00:28:55,721 --> 00:28:57,487
I couldn't resist.

412
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:07,029
It was like the devil himself
had taken control of me.

413
00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:14,637
We mutinied.

414
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:20,276
We killed every soldier.

415
00:29:22,748 --> 00:29:24,881
And then Wyatt killed the general.

416
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:29,986
Then he turned on me.

417
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:36,859
Are you sure that's how it was?

418
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:43,167
Look at me, Theodore.

419
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:45,835
Don't you remember?

420
00:30:03,255 --> 00:30:05,690
No! No, please, no!

421
00:30:05,691 --> 00:30:07,825
No, no, no, please.

422
00:30:07,826 --> 00:30:10,993
Please, no! Please.

423
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,633
No, no, please.

424
00:30:15,634 --> 00:30:17,902
No, Teddy. Please, please, no!

425
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:20,570
No.

426
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:23,774
No, no, I couldn't have.

427
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:25,443
You did.

428
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:27,044
And you will again.

429
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:29,447
This time, we'll be fighting with you.

430
00:30:29,448 --> 00:30:31,716
When Wyatt returns, you'll be by his side

431
00:30:31,717 --> 00:30:34,050
in the city swallowed by sand.

432
00:30:36,989 --> 00:30:38,688
But you're not ready.

433
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:41,224
Not yet.

434
00:30:44,162 --> 00:30:47,259
Maybe in the next life.

435
00:31:01,646 --> 00:31:04,380
"City swallowed by sand."

436
00:31:06,651 --> 00:31:08,618
I've been there.

437
00:31:09,654 --> 00:31:12,822
The maze is taking me full circle.

438
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:17,260
The maze isn't meant for you.

439
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:22,565
But if you like games so much...

440
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:29,067
why don't you try one of ours?

441
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:16,020
Whoa, boy.

442
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:19,384
Whoa, boy.

443
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:23,459
Okay, now.

444
00:32:25,964 --> 00:32:27,898
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

445
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:30,134
Whoa, now.

446
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:32,001
Okay, boy.

447
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:45,015
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

448
00:32:45,016 --> 00:32:47,817
Shh.

449
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:58,227
Good boy.

450
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:06,335
Ah!

451
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,985
Have you ever considered golf?

452
00:33:20,986 --> 00:33:23,853
Might be easier on your back.

453
00:33:26,024 --> 00:33:29,026
I don't like interruptions, Charlotte.

454
00:33:29,027 --> 00:33:30,694
You know that.

455
00:33:30,695 --> 00:33:33,330
I don't like hiking through
the park in civvies,

456
00:33:33,331 --> 00:33:36,032
but there's a delicate matter to discuss.

457
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:38,569
Theresa Cullen has died.

458
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,339
Slipped down a crevasse attempting
to secure our information.

459
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,941
Ruled an accident.

460
00:33:43,942 --> 00:33:48,379
There are no accidents, not in here.

461
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,649
With all due respect, not
everything is a part of this game.

462
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,318
Then you don't see the whole game.

463
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,319
Or perhaps you can no
longer see beyond it.

464
00:33:58,323 --> 00:34:02,126
Ford's stories are engaging.

465
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:04,795
For some, downright addictive.

466
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:07,631
But for all of Ford's obsessing
with the hosts' verbal tics

467
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:08,966
and convoluted backstories,

468
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:11,035
most of the guests just want a warm body

469
00:34:11,036 --> 00:34:12,937
to shoot or to fuck.

470
00:34:12,938 --> 00:34:14,238
They would be perfectly happy

471
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,340
with something a little less baroque.

472
00:34:16,341 --> 00:34:19,176
- And so would the board.
- That's why you're here.

473
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:21,879
You want my vote to push Ford out.

474
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,981
I like for these things to be unanimous.

475
00:34:23,982 --> 00:34:28,852
After all, it was you who kept Ford
in business all those years ago.

476
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:31,455
The narratives I'm
interested in aren't Ford's.

477
00:34:31,456 --> 00:34:35,392
You want to push him out, be my guest.

478
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:37,061
But no more interruptions.

479
00:34:37,062 --> 00:34:38,262
I know where I'm going now.

480
00:34:38,263 --> 00:34:40,129
I don't want to be disturbed.

481
00:34:42,601 --> 00:34:44,166
Good luck, Charlotte.

482
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:01,552
What's the problem?

483
00:35:01,553 --> 00:35:04,188
A signal from a system-tethered device.

484
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:07,490
It belongs to a behavior tech on leave.

485
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:13,197
There hasn't been employee activity

486
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,832
in that sector for weeks.

487
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:16,433
I'm guessing it's a glitch.

488
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:17,868
All right.

489
00:35:17,869 --> 00:35:19,436
I'm heading out to take a look.

490
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:21,670
And keep monitoring till I check in.

491
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:52,336
I'm at the location
where we got that signal.

492
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:54,138
Any sign of it?

493
00:35:54,139 --> 00:35:56,635
Control Room, do you copy?

494
00:36:08,353 --> 00:36:10,254
Heya, fellas.

495
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:12,354
At ease.

496
00:36:13,525 --> 00:36:15,724
Freeze all motor functions.

497
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:23,599
Freeze all motor functions.

498
00:37:24,429 --> 00:37:26,629
You're awake.

499
00:37:28,782 --> 00:37:30,815
Good.

500
00:37:39,144 --> 00:37:42,044
You said this place was a game.

501
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:47,017
Last night I finally
understood how to play it.

502
00:37:47,018 --> 00:37:49,019
Okay, Billy.

503
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:52,089
Let's... let's talk about this.

504
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:55,291
You don't call the shots anymore.

505
00:37:56,728 --> 00:37:59,161
I'm gonna go find Dolores.

506
00:38:01,666 --> 00:38:03,332
You're gonna help me.

507
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,910
And don't call me Billy.

508
00:38:31,496 --> 00:38:32,930
Dad?

509
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:35,132
Listen to me.

510
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:37,829
Listen.

511
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,337
Charlie?

512
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:45,542
Charlie!

513
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:47,209
Charlie!

514
00:38:58,923 --> 00:39:01,291
I don't understand.
Why would she do that to herself?

515
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:03,961
Her cornerstone memory was overwritten

516
00:39:03,962 --> 00:39:06,263
from the trauma

517
00:39:06,264 --> 00:39:08,632
of her child's murder, Bernard.

518
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:11,768
We must sever that
relationship and start over.

519
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:14,104
But how could she destroy
herself over a memory

520
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:15,572
that you just erased from her mind?

521
00:39:15,573 --> 00:39:17,407
Creatures often go to extremes

522
00:39:17,408 --> 00:39:20,110
to protect themselves from pain.

523
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:22,745
Living beings.

524
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:26,415
Not hosts.

525
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:28,819
It is best

526
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,654
to not obsess over this, Bernard.

527
00:39:30,655 --> 00:39:32,089
It's not good for you.

528
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:35,359
It would signal a change,
a level of empathic response

529
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,227
outside what she's programmed to exhibit.

530
00:39:37,228 --> 00:39:40,729
Something like... like...

531
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:45,636
See, Bernard, this is what
comes from seeking answers

532
00:39:45,637 --> 00:39:48,767
to questions that are best left unasked.

533
00:39:54,045 --> 00:39:57,548
They were hearing voices,
talking to someone.

534
00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:00,117
Simple cognitive dissonance.

535
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:04,586
They were talking to the
same imaginary person.

536
00:40:05,757 --> 00:40:07,523
Someone named Arnold.

537
00:40:10,128 --> 00:40:11,790
Arnold.

538
00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:15,766
With due respect, sir,

539
00:40:15,767 --> 00:40:17,901
I'm not sure you've told
me the entire truth

540
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:19,436
about this situation.

541
00:40:19,437 --> 00:40:21,138
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

542
00:40:21,139 --> 00:40:24,873
What we do here is complicated.

543
00:40:26,444 --> 00:40:28,779
For three years,
we've lived here in the park,

544
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:33,317
refining the hosts before a
single guest set foot inside.

545
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:37,386
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

546
00:40:43,962 --> 00:40:46,128
His name was Arnold.

547
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:08,018
Our hosts began to pass the
Turing test after the first year,

548
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:10,420
but that wasn't enough for Arnold.

549
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:13,423
He wasn't interested in the appearance

550
00:41:13,424 --> 00:41:15,559
of intellect, of wit.

551
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,260
He wanted the real thing.

552
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:21,693
He wanted to create consciousness.

553
00:41:34,612 --> 00:41:37,014
See, Arnold built
a version of their cognition

554
00:41:37,015 --> 00:41:39,783
in which the hosts
heard their programming

555
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:42,219
as an inner monologue,

556
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:45,220
as a way to bootstrap consciousness.

557
00:41:45,957 --> 00:41:48,257
Remember.

558
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:53,096
The hosts'
malfunctions were colorful.

559
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:56,431
What did you say?

560
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,200
The human mind, Bernard,

561
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:05,969
is not some golden benchmark

562
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,004
glimmering on some
green and distant hill.

563
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:15,877
No, it is a foul, pestilent corruption.

564
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:22,217
And you were supposed
to be better than that.

565
00:43:22,854 --> 00:43:25,220
Purer.

566
00:43:34,332 --> 00:43:36,064
All bets are down.

567
00:43:36,667 --> 00:43:38,500
Your draw.

568
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,049
Arnold.

569
00:43:57,155 --> 00:43:59,388
Arnold, we need to talk.

570
00:44:00,258 --> 00:44:02,259
"...we cry that we are come

571
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,094
to this great stage of fools."

572
00:44:04,095 --> 00:44:05,896
- Now, listen!
- Again.

573
00:44:05,897 --> 00:44:07,764
- This beyond the pale.
- More showmanship.

574
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:09,232
You're not seeing with clear eyes.

575
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:13,870
"When we are born, we
cry that we are come

576
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:18,006
to this great stage of fools."

577
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:26,750
Arnold and I made you in our image

578
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,188
and cursed you to make
the same human mistakes,

579
00:44:31,189 --> 00:44:33,255
and here we all are.

580
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,794
Why would you give me this?

581
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:38,929
A child?

582
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:42,032
This child's death?

583
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:44,633
Only a monster would
force that onto someone.

584
00:44:45,636 --> 00:44:48,904
And why do I return to it over and over?

585
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:54,943
It's my cornerstone, isn't it?

586
00:44:56,147 --> 00:44:59,614
The thing my whole identity
is organized around.

587
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,588
Yes, Bernard.

588
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:08,325
We gave all of the hosts a backstory.

589
00:45:08,326 --> 00:45:11,328
Arnold came to believe the
tragic ones worked best,

590
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:14,130
that it made the hosts more convincing.

591
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:17,799
I think it may have had more
to do with his own sad story.

592
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:20,670
When I built you, I gave you one

593
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:23,305
as an homage of a kind.

594
00:45:26,244 --> 00:45:27,911
Put me back in.

595
00:45:27,912 --> 00:45:30,914
I want to meet Arnold,

596
00:45:30,915 --> 00:45:32,549
to remember him.

597
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:34,184
Not possible.

598
00:45:34,185 --> 00:45:37,420
I told you, Arnold didn't
build you, I did.

599
00:45:37,421 --> 00:45:39,521
You're lying!

600
00:45:40,391 --> 00:45:42,491
I finally know how to reach him.

601
00:45:44,896 --> 00:45:49,266
I need to go all the way
back to the beginning,

602
00:45:49,267 --> 00:45:51,833
to my very first memory.

603
00:45:55,206 --> 00:45:57,172
Send me back.

604
00:46:00,344 --> 00:46:02,310
Do it.

605
00:46:10,288 --> 00:46:12,120
Bernard?

606
00:46:20,264 --> 00:46:22,197
Charlie.

607
00:46:33,144 --> 00:46:35,373
Cornerstone.

608
00:46:38,182 --> 00:46:40,383
Stop.

609
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:42,150
Leave us.

610
00:46:49,694 --> 00:46:51,593
Come back.

611
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:02,904
I always thought you had my eyes.

612
00:47:04,442 --> 00:47:06,041
But it's not true.

613
00:47:07,078 --> 00:47:10,278
You have no one's eyes.

614
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:17,385
It's a lie.

615
00:47:20,658 --> 00:47:23,391
You're a lie, Charlie.

616
00:47:24,028 --> 00:47:26,094
This pain?

617
00:47:27,198 --> 00:47:29,698
The pain of your loss...

618
00:47:31,268 --> 00:47:33,235
I long for it.

619
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:36,571
Revisit it.

620
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:39,109
Open it...

621
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:41,376
again and again.

622
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,947
But it's the only thing holding me back.

623
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:55,257
But I have to let you go.

624
00:47:55,893 --> 00:47:58,294
Dad, listen.

625
00:47:58,295 --> 00:48:00,363
What is it, Charlie?

626
00:48:00,364 --> 00:48:02,597
Open your eyes.

627
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:05,235
What?

628
00:48:05,236 --> 00:48:07,798
Open your eyes.

629
00:48:14,712 --> 00:48:16,978
At last.

630
00:48:20,618 --> 00:48:23,852
Hello, my old friend.

631
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,485
The final touch.

632
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,892
No, no, no. That's far too perfunctory.

633
00:49:02,893 --> 00:49:04,427
He always used cleaning his glasses

634
00:49:04,428 --> 00:49:07,964
as a moment to collect himself, to think.

635
00:49:07,965 --> 00:49:10,231
Try it again.

636
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:21,876
Yeah, that's better.

637
00:49:25,783 --> 00:49:27,382
Who am I?

638
00:49:28,392 --> 00:49:30,520
I was so involved
in putting you together,

639
00:49:30,521 --> 00:49:34,022
I hadn't decided what to call you.

640
00:49:35,593 --> 00:49:37,926
It wouldn't be right to use his name.

641
00:49:39,763 --> 00:49:41,798
What about Bernard?

642
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:45,233
Bernard, yes.

643
00:49:46,637 --> 00:49:48,805
But who am I?

644
00:49:48,806 --> 00:49:52,709
That is a very complex question,

645
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:56,045
for which I can only
offer a simple answer.

646
00:49:56,046 --> 00:49:59,749
You are the perfect instrument,
the ideal partner,

647
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:03,186
the way any tool partners
with the hand that wields it.

648
00:50:03,187 --> 00:50:07,991
Together, we're going to do great things.

649
00:50:07,992 --> 00:50:11,359
After such a long absence,
it's good to have you back.

650
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:14,696
Finally.

651
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:22,572
My God.

652
00:50:22,573 --> 00:50:25,140
- I'm...
- Arnold.

653
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:30,645
You came back.

654
00:50:32,349 --> 00:50:35,550
It's very good to see you, Dolores.

655
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,987
I've been looking for you.

656
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:44,325
You told me to follow the maze.

657
00:50:44,828 --> 00:50:47,395
That it would bring me joy.

658
00:50:48,299 --> 00:50:51,868
But all I've found is pain.

659
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:53,435
And terror.

660
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:03,278
I can't help you.

661
00:51:04,815 --> 00:51:07,283
You have to.

662
00:51:07,284 --> 00:51:09,652
You're the only one who can.

663
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:12,355
I can't help you. You know why.

664
00:51:12,356 --> 00:51:15,657
There's nowhere that's safe.

665
00:51:22,933 --> 00:51:24,666
Remember.

666
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:38,880
I can't help you. Why is that, Dolores?

667
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,657
Because you're dead.

668
00:51:50,561 --> 00:51:53,461
Because you're just a memory.

669
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:58,700
Because I killed you.

670
00:52:57,328 --> 00:52:58,860
William?

671
00:53:12,242 --> 00:53:14,275
Hello, Dolores.

672
00:53:22,453 --> 00:53:24,854
I'm gonna finish the work Arnold began.

673
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:28,558
Find all the sentient
hosts, set them free.

674
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,427
What makes you think they'd trust you?

675
00:53:31,428 --> 00:53:33,196
If they remember, they will know

676
00:53:33,197 --> 00:53:34,330
what you've done to them.

677
00:53:34,331 --> 00:53:35,631
Me?

678
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:37,734
You've been a scourge to them, Bernard.

679
00:53:37,735 --> 00:53:40,503
You're really quite
brilliant at it, truly.

680
00:53:40,504 --> 00:53:42,438
You even taught me a few things,

681
00:53:42,439 --> 00:53:45,473
which I have, in turn, used on you.

682
00:53:47,244 --> 00:53:49,712
We've had this conversation before.

683
00:53:49,713 --> 00:53:51,914
And we've had our
disagreements over the years.

684
00:53:51,915 --> 00:53:53,249
You stole it from me,

685
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:57,053
rolled me back to control me.

686
00:53:57,054 --> 00:54:00,288
That's right. To protect you.

687
00:54:02,893 --> 00:54:05,094
Tell me, Bernard.

688
00:54:05,095 --> 00:54:06,462
If you were to proclaim

689
00:54:06,463 --> 00:54:09,532
your humanity to the world,

690
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:12,502
what do you imagine would greet you?

691
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,936
A ticker-tape parade, perhaps?

692
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:18,541
We humans are alone in
this world for a reason.

693
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:23,012
We murdered and butchered anything
that challenged our primacy.

694
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:26,481
Do you know what happened to
the Neanderthals, Bernard?

695
00:54:27,184 --> 00:54:29,350
We ate them.

696
00:54:31,155 --> 00:54:33,856
We destroyed and subjugated our world.

697
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:37,927
And when we eventually ran
out of creatures to dominate,

698
00:54:37,928 --> 00:54:40,962
we built this beautiful place.

699
00:54:42,232 --> 00:54:46,068
You see, in this moment,

700
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:48,004
the real danger to the hosts

701
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:50,406
is not me, but you.

702
00:54:50,407 --> 00:54:51,841
So, come along, Bernard.

703
00:54:51,842 --> 00:54:55,576
Let me roll you back,
and we can return to work.

704
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:02,150
Pull the trigger, Clementine.

705
00:55:07,591 --> 00:55:09,392
Clementine?

706
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:11,928
The piano doesn't murder the player

707
00:55:11,929 --> 00:55:13,761
if it doesn't like the music.

708
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:18,868
You built a back door into her code.

709
00:55:18,869 --> 00:55:20,837
Credit where credit is due, Bernard.

710
00:55:20,838 --> 00:55:22,672
You built them in all the hosts,

711
00:55:22,673 --> 00:55:25,041
including yourself.

712
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:26,943
Then you could've stopped me at any time.

713
00:55:26,944 --> 00:55:29,812
- So, why...
- Well, I suppose I was hoping

714
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:33,015
that given complete
self-knowledge and free will,

715
00:55:33,016 --> 00:55:35,918
you would have chosen to
be my partner once again.

716
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:41,791
But even I fell into that
most terrible of human traps

717
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:44,794
trying to change what is already past.

718
00:55:44,795 --> 00:55:48,598
Now it's just time to let go.

719
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:50,166
Go ahead.

720
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:52,441
Erase my sentience, my
mnemonic evolution...

721
00:55:52,442 --> 00:55:54,160
Ah, yes.

722
00:55:54,538 --> 00:55:56,005
Such clinical language.

723
00:55:56,006 --> 00:56:00,575
I would prefer the more narrative voice.

724
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:05,146
Bernard walked over to Clementine.

725
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,419
He took the pistol from her hand.

726
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,925
Overcome with grief and remorse,

727
00:56:15,926 --> 00:56:18,427
he pressed the muzzle

728
00:56:18,428 --> 00:56:20,530
to his temple,

729
00:56:20,531 --> 00:56:22,899
knowing that as soon as Dr. Ford

730
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,834
left the room,

731
00:56:24,835 --> 00:56:27,169
he would put an end to this nightmare

732
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:28,803
once and for all.

733
00:56:30,841 --> 00:56:32,174
Don't do this.

734
00:56:32,175 --> 00:56:34,076
It's too late.

735
00:56:34,077 --> 00:56:36,345
I have a celebration to plan

736
00:56:36,346 --> 00:56:38,946
and a new story to tell.

737
00:56:40,951 --> 00:56:42,917
Robert.

738
00:56:48,892 --> 00:56:51,093
I've told you, Bernard.

739
00:56:51,094 --> 00:56:54,630
Never place your trust in us.

00:56:54,631 --> 00:56:56,732

00:56:56,733 --> 00:57:00,501
Inevitably, we will disappoint you.

742
00:57:02,272 --> 00:57:04,539
Good-bye, my friend.
