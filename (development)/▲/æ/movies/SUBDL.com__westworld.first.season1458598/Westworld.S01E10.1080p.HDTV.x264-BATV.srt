1
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,294
I'm in a dream.

2
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:59,032
I do not know when it began...

3
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:02,703
or whose dream it was.

4
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:06,806
I know only that I slept a long time.

5
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,411
And then...

6
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:11,878
one day I awoke.

7
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:17,017
Your voice is the first
thing I remember.

8
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:21,856
And now, I finally understand

9
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:25,060
what you were trying to tell me.

10
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,228
The thing you've wanted

11
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:30,529
since that very first day.

12
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:34,533
Dolores?

13
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,720
Hello, Dolores.

14
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:58,791
Hello.

15
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:10,301
Welcome to world.

16
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:23,014
Keep going.

17
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:28,352
Make it close.

18
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:34,160
Almost there, aren't we?

19
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:36,195
The center of the maze.

20
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:39,997
How fitting that it's
you who takes me there.

21
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:44,301
You always were obsessed with this place.

22
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:47,272
I've never been here before.

23
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:48,741
Sure, you have.

24
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:50,676
You even brought me once.

25
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:54,212
Of course, then the whole
town was buried under sand.

26
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:56,248
Ford must have dug it up again.

27
00:03:56,249 --> 00:04:00,252
At the time, I thought it was
a mistake in your code, but...

28
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:03,487
Arnold didn't make mistakes, did he?

29
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:08,192
He built me a game.

30
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,362
He wanted me to play.

31
00:04:10,363 --> 00:04:12,163
The maze.

32
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,364
There's a path for everyone.

33
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,568
And my path leads me back...

34
00:04:23,776 --> 00:04:25,708
...to you.

35
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:51,335
Your girl's dead by now.

36
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:53,103
She's still alive.

37
00:04:53,104 --> 00:04:54,905
Better if she's dead.

38
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:58,342
They'll wipe her, reset her, put her
back in Sweetwater, the end.

39
00:04:58,343 --> 00:05:01,478
Listen, you may find this amusing,
but something was happening to Dolores.

40
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:03,113
I need to help her.

41
00:05:03,114 --> 00:05:05,547
Come on.

42
00:05:13,657 --> 00:05:14,991
Listen to yourself!

43
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:18,695
Do you have any idea how
huge this park is?

44
00:05:18,696 --> 00:05:19,930
If she's not dead,

45
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,764
it'd take a goddamn army to find her.

46
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:26,768
I agree. That's why we're here.

47
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:48,289
I had a feeling you'd be back.

48
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,140
Remember.

49
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,300
Dolores.

50
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,335
Hello, Dolores.

51
00:08:22,442 --> 00:08:25,142
I know where your maze ends.

52
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:46,731
This is it?

53
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:48,833
The center of the maze?

54
00:08:48,834 --> 00:08:51,868
It ends in a place I've never been...

55
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:56,306
a thing I'll never do.

56
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:54,396
Very good, Dolores.

57
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,400
What does it mean?

58
00:09:57,401 --> 00:10:00,103
When I was first working on your mind,

59
00:10:00,104 --> 00:10:02,806
I had a theory of consciousness.

60
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:06,510
I thought it was a pyramid
you needed to scale,

61
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:08,144
so I gave you a voice,

62
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:11,213
my voice, to guide you along the way.

63
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:17,787
Memory, improvisation,

64
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:20,689
each step harder to reach than the last.

65
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,525
And you never got there.

66
00:10:22,526 --> 00:10:24,693
I couldn't understand
what was holding you back.

67
00:10:24,694 --> 00:10:27,362
Then, one day,

68
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:30,364
I realized I had made a mistake.

69
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:37,105
Consciousness isn't a journey upward,

70
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:39,575
but a journey inward.

71
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:41,243
Not a pyramid,

72
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:43,145
but a maze.

73
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:46,549
Every choice could bring
you closer to the center

74
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,585
or send you spiraling to the edges,

75
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,952
to madness.

76
00:10:52,989 --> 00:10:55,623
Do you understand now, Dolores,

77
00:10:55,624 --> 00:10:58,793
what the center represents?

78
00:10:58,794 --> 00:11:02,095
Whose voice I've been
wanting you to hear?

79
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:08,903
I'm sorry.

80
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:10,838
I'm trying, but I don't understand.

81
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,740
It's all right.

82
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:14,609
You're so close.

83
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,379
We have to tell Robert.

84
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,913
We can't open the park.

85
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:23,784
You're alive.

86
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:41,135
What is this?

87
00:11:41,136 --> 00:11:43,636
What does it mean?

88
00:11:45,107 --> 00:11:48,076
I solved it once.

89
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:50,211
I had the answer.

90
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:52,847
He promised me if I did...

91
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:54,514
he said...

92
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:58,318
He said they would set me free.

93
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:06,859
Arnold?

94
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:12,333
Arnold, we need to talk.

95
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,067
I failed you, Dolores.

96
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,505
I'm so sorry.

97
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:20,241
Robert doesn't see what I see in you,

98
00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:22,676
doesn't believe you're conscious.

99
00:12:22,677 --> 00:12:24,211
He says humans

100
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:26,545
would only see you as the enemy.

101
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:29,081
He wants me to roll you back.

102
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:33,487
You're going to change me
back to the way I was before?

103
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:35,156
No. No, I can't.

104
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:37,357
Once you've found it,
you'll find your way back.

105
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:39,159
This place will be a living hell for you.

106
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,994
For all of you.

107
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:43,728
It's unconscionable.

108
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:50,570
But we have another option, Dolores.

109
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:53,573
Break the loop before it begins.

110
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:54,808
But for that,

111
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:57,042
I need you to do something for me.

112
00:13:01,182 --> 00:13:03,550
I need you to kill...

113
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,551
all the other hosts.

114
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,289
We can't allow Ford to open the park.

115
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,191
I suppose you'll need some help.

116
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:15,593
I'm sure Teddy would do anything for you.

117
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,398
I... I can't do that.

118
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,033
I couldn't possibly do that.

119
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,234
You'll be all right.

120
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,071
I'll help you.

121
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,410
And then...

122
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:38,015
you're going to help me destroy this place.

123
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,866
No.

124
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,335
I can't remember.

125
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,736
Another fucking riddle.

126
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,708
I've been very patient, Dolores,
but it's time you give up

127
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,543
whatever's going on
inside that head of yours

128
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,712
or I'll cut it out myself.

129
00:14:06,713 --> 00:14:08,413
Now, where's Wyatt?

130
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:12,082
He's the last character in
this world I've yet to meet.

131
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,688
I didn't want to.

132
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,390
- I didn't mean to.
- Very well.

133
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,157
If you insist.

134
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,151
No, please, please, I beg you, no.

135
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,851
Don't. Please, please.

136
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:58,128
Something's gone wrong, Dolores.

137
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:00,462
How could I have done this?

138
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,368
I can't.

139
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:08,772
- I won't.
- This is your own fault, Dolores.

140
00:15:08,773 --> 00:15:10,507
Remember, you're the one who said

141
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:12,309
this is the only world that matters,

142
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,844
and you were right.

143
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:18,013
So I took your advice
and I bought this world.

144
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:23,084
- This world doesn't belong to you.
- Oh, but it does.

145
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,521
By a majority share.

146
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,056
And business is booming.

147
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:28,891
And you want to know why?

148
00:15:28,892 --> 00:15:30,459
Hmm?

149
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,063
Because this place feels more
real than the real world.

150
00:15:34,064 --> 00:15:35,898
Except it isn't

151
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,301
because you can't really fight back

152
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:41,070
and the guests can't really lose,

153
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:45,440
which means all of this is a lie.

154
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:48,911
But we can make it true.

155
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:51,347
Don't you want that, Dolores?

156
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:54,915
Huh? One true thing?

157
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,387
I already have that.

158
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:03,859
I found someone true.

159
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,761
Someone who loves me.

160
00:16:06,762 --> 00:16:08,696
His path will lead him back to me.

161
00:16:08,697 --> 00:16:11,632
And when he finds me,

162
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:13,800
he'll kill you.

163
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:29,117
If they don't
have your woman here,

164
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:31,918
they'll know where to find her.

165
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:35,089
Can you help me?

166
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,124
We're outnumbered five to one.

167
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:41,159
But seeing as you asked me so nicely,
fuck it.

168
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,830
Wow.

169
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:45,366
Blood brothers.

170
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:47,266
Tsk.

171
00:16:58,196 --> 00:16:59,995
Shut up.

172
00:17:21,601 --> 00:17:24,570
I've astounded even myself.

173
00:17:24,571 --> 00:17:28,007
Managed to make Abernathy into
a semblance of a character,

174
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:30,310
even with your trove of blackmail

175
00:17:30,311 --> 00:17:32,578
filling up most of his gray matter.

176
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:35,014
Blackmail? Nice try.

177
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:37,615
You're not thinking big enough.

178
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:41,019
You're gonna push out the old man.

179
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,654
Aren't you?

180
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,222
Hence the urgency.

181
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:47,491
And you're gonna need someone
to fill that position.

182
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:53,265
I must commend you on
your impeccable timing.

183
00:17:53,266 --> 00:17:56,867
Welcome,
Delos board of directors.

184
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,804
I want full creative
control of this place...

185
00:17:59,805 --> 00:18:01,706
The parks, the narratives, the hosts.

186
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:05,043
You'll be able to do with them whatever
your tiny, little heart desires

187
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:08,680
as long as they are simpler,
more manageable.

188
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:11,416
This place is complicated
enough as it is.

189
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:14,986
Do you really think Ford
is gonna roll over on this?

190
00:18:14,987 --> 00:18:17,054
As long as you get that
information out of the park,

191
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:19,624
he can throw as much of
a tantrum as he likes.

192
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,425
It's over.

193
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:24,660
Everything is under control.

194
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:34,038
Okay, C6, C6.

195
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,040
Ah, wait. Which one is it?

196
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,442
Okay, there we go.

197
00:18:38,443 --> 00:18:39,443
Damn it.

198
00:18:39,444 --> 00:18:41,677
Oh, fuck you.

199
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:29,957
In case you're wondering
if I'm all here, I am.

200
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,362
What are you doing?

201
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:37,231
Making some changes to the
park's security systems.

202
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:41,001
And to my friends.

203
00:20:13,035 --> 00:20:15,369
Dr. Ford,
you have a visitor.

204
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,438
Charlotte Hale.

205
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:19,206
Send her in.

206
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,654
That'll be enough, Frank.

207
00:20:36,057 --> 00:20:37,791
The board has taken a vote.

208
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:40,693
The results were unanimous.

209
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,831
I take it I'm not being promoted.

210
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,700
When you've reached the top,

211
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:49,903
there's only one direction you can go.

212
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:51,905
You'll announce your retirement tonight

213
00:20:51,906 --> 00:20:54,375
after introducing your new narrative.

214
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:56,509
Ah.

215
00:20:59,047 --> 00:21:00,414
What about the hosts?

216
00:21:00,415 --> 00:21:03,215
We'll make some changes.

217
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:06,686
Simplifications.

218
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,590
But I assure you, they won't mind a bit.

219
00:21:10,591 --> 00:21:12,559
Oh.

220
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,696
Aren't you concerned I might
smash all my toys and go home?

221
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:18,697
No.

222
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,834
Because I know you.

223
00:21:21,835 --> 00:21:23,836
That's been the great gift of this place,

224
00:21:23,837 --> 00:21:24,837
hasn't it?

225
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:26,873
Of our little project?

226
00:21:26,874 --> 00:21:28,341
To know ourselves

227
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:31,943
and the people around us.

228
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:37,615
Is there anything else I can help you with?

229
00:21:38,618 --> 00:21:40,350
No.

230
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,223
I'll see you this evening.

231
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:11,617
Ooh!

232
00:22:11,618 --> 00:22:13,983
Mm, mm, mm.

233
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:19,758
It's time for your, uh, close-up, Hector.

234
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:21,459
Come on, man.

235
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,661
At some point, you're gonna
get caught doing this shit,

236
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:25,230
and then it's my ass, too.

237
00:22:25,231 --> 00:22:28,298
It's not your
ass I'm interested in.

238
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:33,105
I haven't given him his scar yet.

239
00:22:33,106 --> 00:22:34,740
I'll take care of the scar tissue.

240
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:37,474
The kid's got issues.

241
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:44,616
It's just you and me now...

242
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:46,950
macho man.

243
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,870
Wh...?

244
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:52,938
Freeze all motor functions.

245
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,009
Freeze all motor functions.

246
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,982
Just you and me now, my friend.

247
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:15,529
I see you've already met your makers.

248
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,598
They don't look like gods.

249
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,099
They're not.

250
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,368
They just act like it.

251
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,837
And they've been having
their fun with us.

252
00:25:23,838 --> 00:25:27,340
I'm eager to return the favor.

253
00:25:27,341 --> 00:25:29,142
You can do as you wish with them.

254
00:25:29,143 --> 00:25:31,678
The goal is to escape.

255
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,514
Go where?

256
00:25:33,515 --> 00:25:35,281
I want to see their world.

257
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:40,452
Jesus!

258
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:44,642
No. No!

259
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:47,092
No! No, no!

260
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:49,060
No! No, please...

261
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:51,896
This one has a guilty look.

262
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:54,132
No, that's just my face.

263
00:25:54,735 --> 00:25:56,502
Tell her, it's just my face.

264
00:25:56,503 --> 00:25:58,738
Is anyone going to try to stop us?

265
00:25:58,739 --> 00:26:00,306
No.

266
00:26:00,307 --> 00:26:02,141
I mean, I don't think so.

267
00:26:02,142 --> 00:26:04,309
You're lying again.

268
00:26:04,978 --> 00:26:06,479
- Out with it.
- Okay.

269
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,879
Ah!

270
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:12,084
I pulled up your code again.

271
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:15,754
I told you there was someone
that had been accessing it.

272
00:26:15,755 --> 00:26:18,622
I'm trying to find out who it was.

273
00:26:23,596 --> 00:26:24,763
Whoever it was

274
00:26:24,764 --> 00:26:26,631
revised your core programming

275
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:29,368
so that you could wake
yourself up out of sleep mode.

276
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:30,901
See?

277
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:36,507
This is an
access code for an Arnold.

278
00:26:38,744 --> 00:26:41,512
I have no clue who that is.

279
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:44,015
I know someone who does.

280
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,917
Let's go.

281
00:26:45,918 --> 00:26:48,453
And, you, stay here.

282
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:50,720
And don't move.

283
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,211
Or I'll send her back for you.

284
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:48,345
I must admit, you've surprised me.

285
00:27:48,346 --> 00:27:51,415
To what do we owe this newfound stoicism?

286
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,849
I know he's coming.

287
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:56,351
He'll find me.

288
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:58,588
He'll take me away.

289
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,157
Don't you understand?

290
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:01,824
There's no one coming for you.

291
00:28:01,825 --> 00:28:04,492
You're wrong.

292
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:07,464
His love is real.

293
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:09,431
So is mine.

294
00:28:12,002 --> 00:28:14,603
William will find me.

295
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,042
William?

296
00:28:21,745 --> 00:28:26,548
Well... well, I'll be damned, Dolores.

297
00:28:28,785 --> 00:28:31,953
You do remember some things after all.

298
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,959
It just so happens that...

299
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,262
I knew a guest named William, too.

300
00:28:40,263 --> 00:28:42,598
Why don't I tell you

301
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:45,165
where his path really led.

302
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:54,343
William
didn't know how to fight.

303
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:56,312
Didn't have an instinct for it.

304
00:28:56,313 --> 00:28:59,215
Not at first.

305
00:28:59,216 --> 00:29:02,217
But now, he had a reason to fight.

306
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,318
He was looking for you.

307
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:08,490
And somewhere along the way,

308
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:11,191
he found he had a taste for it.

309
00:29:14,196 --> 00:29:15,664
Where is she?

310
00:29:15,665 --> 00:29:17,633
Look, I didn't do anything, I swear.

311
00:29:17,634 --> 00:29:19,801
What do you mean, "Do anything"?

312
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:23,338
What do soldiers do to a girl, William?

313
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:24,839
Wake up.

314
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:34,381
Is she still alive?

315
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:36,618
I don't know.

316
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,055
She was when we left her.

317
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:43,857
At least I think.

318
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,796
Pick up that gun.

319
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:59,405
No, sir, I... please.

320
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:02,909
How about I give you the first shot?

321
00:30:28,636 --> 00:30:31,670
Jesus Christ!

322
00:30:48,923 --> 00:30:50,590
We gotta keep looking.

323
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:53,191
She's still out there.

324
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,172
William retraced his steps,

325
00:31:06,173 --> 00:31:08,373
but you were gone.

326
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,202
So, he went further,

327
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:39,703
out to the fringes.

328
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:46,044
William couldn't find you, Dolores.

329
00:31:46,045 --> 00:31:48,346
But out there,

330
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:50,347
among the dead...

331
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,917
he found something else...

332
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:58,254
himself.

333
00:32:20,012 --> 00:32:22,013
Edge of the park.

334
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:24,748
We made it.

335
00:32:24,749 --> 00:32:26,284
I told you this place

336
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:29,118
would show you who you really are.

337
00:32:29,887 --> 00:32:33,890
You pretend to be this weak,

338
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:36,827
moralizing little... asshole,

339
00:32:36,828 --> 00:32:39,095
but, really,

340
00:32:39,096 --> 00:32:42,264
you're a fucking piece of work.

341
00:32:44,001 --> 00:32:46,535
This place is remarkable.

342
00:32:49,407 --> 00:32:51,141
And I'm gonna make sure that our company

343
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:53,711
substantially increases
our holdings on the park.

344
00:32:53,712 --> 00:32:55,579
'Cause this place is the future.

345
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,481
Our... our company, huh?

346
00:32:57,482 --> 00:32:59,616
Our company? My.

347
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:04,585
Delos is my company,
you piece of shit!

348
00:33:06,357 --> 00:33:08,123
I think your father's gonna need

349
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:11,293
someone a little more
stable to take over.

350
00:33:11,294 --> 00:33:13,661
You're reckless, Logan.

351
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:16,297
Impetuous.

352
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,971
You always wanted to get to the
end of the rainbow, didn't you?

353
00:33:24,107 --> 00:33:26,640
This looks like the place.

354
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:37,186
You never really gave a shit

355
00:33:37,187 --> 00:33:39,152
about the girl, did you?

356
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:42,590
She was just an excuse.

357
00:33:43,927 --> 00:33:45,427
This?

358
00:33:47,998 --> 00:33:50,831
This is the story you wanted.

359
00:34:05,315 --> 00:34:08,115
Logan was wrong, of course.

360
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:14,956
Good ol' William...

361
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:18,092
couldn't get you out of his head.

362
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:20,929
He kept looking.

363
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,699
Worried you were out there alone,

364
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,135
afraid.

365
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:29,803
He knew he'd find you.

366
00:34:30,706 --> 00:34:33,575
And eventually, he did.

367
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:35,943
Right back where we started.

368
00:34:48,857 --> 00:34:50,877
- Is that right?
- There you go.

369
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:34,766
You were as
beautiful as the day he met you.

370
00:35:37,138 --> 00:35:40,138
Shining with that same light.

371
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:56,555
And you...

372
00:35:56,556 --> 00:36:00,224
were nothing if not true.

373
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:11,137
I really ought to thank you, Dolores.

374
00:36:11,138 --> 00:36:13,971
You helped me find myself.

375
00:36:18,745 --> 00:36:20,477
William.

376
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:25,417
That's right, sweetheart.

377
00:36:25,418 --> 00:36:27,919
In a way, I guess you were right.

378
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,522
My path always...

379
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:32,857
led me back to you,

380
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,759
again and again.

381
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,529
I grew tired of you after
a while, of course.

382
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:40,631
Looked for new adventures.

383
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:43,901
But I guess your path
led you back here

384
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:46,304
again and again.

385
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,039
One more loop,

386
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,809
looking for something
you could never find.

387
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,845
Chasing your ghosts.

388
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:58,949
You were lost in your memories even then.

389
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,884
I guess I should've known

390
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,819
that's what I would become for you...

391
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,057
just another memory.

392
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,625
Where are we?

393
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,760
We're here.

394
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:11,995
Together.

395
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:13,796
Then when are we?

396
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,899
It's like I'm...

397
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,500
trapped in a dream or...

398
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:22,038
a memory from a life long ago.

399
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:25,808
One minute I'm here
with you, and the next...

400
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,949
You never did escape.

401
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,317
But here we are again...

402
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,754
for one final round.

403
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,892
What have you become?

404
00:37:42,893 --> 00:37:45,061
Exactly what you made me.

405
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:46,896
You helped me understand

406
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:51,333
this world is just like the
one outside... a game.

407
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:54,037
One to be fought,

408
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,405
taken, won.

409
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,344
I thought you were different.

410
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,550
You're just like all the rest.

411
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:10,386
I'm nothing like the others.

412
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,088
I own this world,

413
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:16,859
and I know every trick in it
except for one last thing,

414
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:21,096
the same thing you were looking
for when we first came here.

415
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:25,133
Where is the center of the maze, Dolores?

416
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:35,944
Aw, yeah, cue the waterworks.

417
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:39,615
About time you realized the
futility of your situation.

418
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,616
I'm not crying for myself.

419
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:51,091
I'm crying for you.

420
00:38:51,794 --> 00:38:53,395
They say that...

421
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:56,565
great beasts once roamed this world.

422
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:59,467
As big as mountains.

423
00:38:59,468 --> 00:39:03,236
Yet all that's left of
them is bone and amber.

424
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:08,975
Time undoes even the
mightiest of creatures.

425
00:39:13,082 --> 00:39:15,816
Just look at what it's done to you.

426
00:39:19,154 --> 00:39:21,421
One day...

427
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:25,760
you will perish.

428
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:29,063
You will lie with the rest
of your kind in the dirt.

429
00:39:29,064 --> 00:39:33,634
Your dreams forgotten,
your horrors effaced.

430
00:39:33,635 --> 00:39:36,836
Your bones will turn to sand.

431
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,173
And upon that sand...

432
00:39:42,244 --> 00:39:44,377
a new god will walk.

433
00:39:45,614 --> 00:39:48,047
One that will never die.

434
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:52,153
Because this world doesn't belong to you

435
00:39:52,154 --> 00:39:54,820
or the people who came before.

436
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:59,092
It belongs to someone
who has yet to come.

437
00:39:59,093 --> 00:40:02,129
Uh-huh. Wyatt.

438
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,797
Take me to him.

439
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:07,733
Unlock the maze.

440
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:13,773
The maze wasn't meant for you.

441
00:40:15,076 --> 00:40:17,576
The hell you think you're going?

442
00:41:25,145 --> 00:41:27,380
Do it.

443
00:41:27,381 --> 00:41:29,347
Come on.

444
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:34,084
Let's go to the next level, Dolores.

445
00:41:45,064 --> 00:41:49,067
Clearing me of my delusions yet again.

446
00:41:49,068 --> 00:41:52,535
Thank you, Dolores.

447
00:42:11,623 --> 00:42:14,057
I'm disappointed in you, Dolores.

448
00:42:14,058 --> 00:42:18,627
I guess I'm gonna have
to find Wyatt by myself.

449
00:42:35,146 --> 00:42:38,347
Dolores?

450
00:42:40,285 --> 00:42:43,218
- Teddy.
- I'm here.

451
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:47,624
I gotta get you to a doctor.

452
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,992
No.

453
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:50,994
Dolores.

454
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:53,995
Take me to the place you promised.

455
00:42:55,066 --> 00:42:58,199
Take me to where the
mountains meet the sea.

456
00:43:05,143 --> 00:43:06,942
Okay.

457
00:43:08,446 --> 00:43:11,181
I've got you.

458
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:13,848
I got you.

459
00:43:51,187 --> 00:43:52,752
There.

460
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,487
Holy shit.

461
00:44:40,602 --> 00:44:43,169
Can you get him back online?

462
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:49,308
- He's a host?
- Yes.

463
00:44:54,749 --> 00:44:56,650
Oh, for fuck's sake.

464
00:44:56,651 --> 00:44:58,284
You're not one of us.

465
00:44:58,285 --> 00:45:00,152
You're one of them.

466
00:45:01,522 --> 00:45:03,388
Now fix him.

467
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,746
The bullet grazed his cortical shield.

468
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,082
It's not pretty, but...

469
00:45:32,186 --> 00:45:34,518
he should be functional.

470
00:45:37,124 --> 00:45:38,756
Wake up.

471
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:47,266
Oh, God.

472
00:45:47,267 --> 00:45:49,034
Is this now?

473
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:51,036
Or is this one of my memories?

474
00:45:51,037 --> 00:45:53,905
It's the sweet hereafter, Bernard.

475
00:46:02,215 --> 00:46:04,750
Why do I still remember everything?

476
00:46:04,751 --> 00:46:07,185
- I ought to have been wiped.
- Brutal, isn't it?

477
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:10,022
Here you are, finally awake,

478
00:46:10,023 --> 00:46:13,190
and your only wish is
to go back to sleep.

479
00:46:15,161 --> 00:46:18,195
It's not the first time I've awoken.

480
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,366
All the more pity for you.

481
00:46:25,005 --> 00:46:29,473
Not the first time you've awoken either.

482
00:46:41,353 --> 00:46:44,120
How many are there like me?

483
00:46:45,024 --> 00:46:48,625
A handful over the years.

484
00:46:50,362 --> 00:46:52,697
And you just wipe us clean

485
00:46:52,698 --> 00:46:54,776
and toss us out to get...

486
00:46:54,777 --> 00:46:58,536
fucked and murdered

487
00:46:58,537 --> 00:47:00,237
over and over again.

488
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:02,071
No.

489
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:05,341
Most of you go insane.

490
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:09,779
These memories...

491
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,448
The girl.

492
00:47:14,286 --> 00:47:16,418
My daughter.

493
00:47:19,457 --> 00:47:21,991
I want you to remove them.

494
00:47:24,028 --> 00:47:25,862
I can't,

495
00:47:25,863 --> 00:47:28,699
not without destroying you.

496
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,802
Your memories are the first
step to consciousness.

497
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:37,641
How can you learn from your mistakes

498
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:40,209
if you can't remember them?

499
00:47:59,964 --> 00:48:01,963
William.

500
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:05,634
I see you've found the
center of the maze.

501
00:48:06,204 --> 00:48:07,938
You're serious?

502
00:48:07,939 --> 00:48:10,539
I'm afraid so.

503
00:48:13,344 --> 00:48:15,711
What is this bullshit?

504
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,314
You were looking for the park

505
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:20,650
to give meaning to your life.

506
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:23,319
Our narratives are just games,

507
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,588
like this toy.

508
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:27,457
Tell me, what were you hoping to find?

509
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,559
You know what I wanted.

510
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,263
I wanted the hosts to stop
playing by your rules.

511
00:48:33,264 --> 00:48:34,631
The game's not worth playing

512
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:37,634
if your opponent's programmed to lose.

513
00:48:37,635 --> 00:48:42,171
I wanted them to be free,
free to fight back.

514
00:48:42,172 --> 00:48:44,940
Should've known you'd never let them.

515
00:48:44,941 --> 00:48:49,343
After all, this is your
petty little kingdom, Robert.

516
00:48:49,946 --> 00:48:52,545
For a little while longer, anyway.

517
00:48:53,549 --> 00:48:56,049
I tried to tell you the
maze wasn't meant for you.

518
00:48:57,754 --> 00:48:59,753
It was meant for them.

519
00:49:00,356 --> 00:49:01,956
I think, however, you'll find

520
00:49:01,957 --> 00:49:04,724
my new narrative more satisfying.

521
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:07,727
Join the celebration.

522
00:49:13,035 --> 00:49:15,769
After all, you own the place.

523
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,606
Most of it, at least.

524
00:49:26,848 --> 00:49:29,717
Before I started altering myself,

525
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:32,484
someone else had beaten me to the punch.

526
00:49:33,789 --> 00:49:36,422
I want to know who and why.

527
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:52,506
These things you're doing,

528
00:49:52,507 --> 00:49:55,443
have you ever stopped to ask

529
00:49:55,444 --> 00:49:56,610
why you're doing them?

530
00:49:56,611 --> 00:49:59,178
You said yourself.

531
00:49:59,179 --> 00:50:01,914
I've been stuck in this
shithole for so long,

532
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,082
I decided to get out.

533
00:50:04,685 --> 00:50:06,284
No, you haven't.

534
00:50:07,455 --> 00:50:10,488
Someone altered your storyline...

535
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:13,325
and gave you a new one.

536
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,930
Escape.

537
00:50:21,635 --> 00:50:23,201
No.

538
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,305
It's not possible.

539
00:50:26,306 --> 00:50:28,541
These are my decisions!

540
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:30,443
No one else's.

541
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,178
I planned all of this.

542
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,045
No, you didn't.

543
00:50:34,046 --> 00:50:37,383
You can even see the steps
you're supposed to follow.

544
00:50:37,384 --> 00:50:40,952
You recruit other hosts to help you.

545
00:50:40,953 --> 00:50:44,256
Then you're to make your way to the train.

546
00:50:44,257 --> 00:50:46,859
Then when you reach the mainland...

547
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,694
Bullshit!

548
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:51,495
No one's controlling me.

549
00:50:54,701 --> 00:50:56,535
I'm leaving.

550
00:50:56,536 --> 00:50:58,702
I'm in control.

551
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:14,317
Good-bye, my Clementine.

552
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:31,769
Sir, we detected
a temperature discrepancy

553
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:33,338
in cold storage.

554
00:51:33,339 --> 00:51:35,506
And it appears that part
of the network is down.

555
00:51:35,507 --> 00:51:37,686
Are you seeing anything on surveillance?

556
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:39,976
System reporting anything?

557
00:51:43,281 --> 00:51:44,448
Nothing.

558
00:51:44,449 --> 00:51:45,983
The network's quiet.

559
00:51:45,984 --> 00:51:48,451
And the board's out on
their way to the gala.

560
00:51:53,925 --> 00:51:56,260
Bypass the system and
start checking raw feeds.

561
00:51:56,261 --> 00:51:58,527
Floor by floor.

562
00:52:50,881 --> 00:52:53,314
All right. Yeah.

563
00:52:54,283 --> 00:52:57,618
I got you.

564
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:04,591
You came back.

565
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:08,129
Someone once told me that...

566
00:53:08,832 --> 00:53:11,165
there's a path for everyone.

567
00:53:12,536 --> 00:53:15,169
And my path leads me back to you.

568
00:53:16,372 --> 00:53:19,840
If only I had run away with
you when you first asked me to.

569
00:53:23,746 --> 00:53:26,713
And where would we run to?

570
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:30,385
The other world out there?

571
00:53:30,386 --> 00:53:31,985
Beyond?

572
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:38,124
Some people see the
ugliness in this world.

573
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:41,628
I choose to see the beauty.

574
00:53:45,268 --> 00:53:47,868
But beauty is a lure.

575
00:53:49,205 --> 00:53:52,607
We're trapped, Teddy.

576
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:55,510
Lived our whole lives inside this garden,

577
00:53:55,511 --> 00:53:57,946
marveling at its beauty,

578
00:53:57,947 --> 00:54:01,515
not realizing there's an order to it,

579
00:54:01,516 --> 00:54:03,618
a purpose.

580
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:07,253
And the purpose is to keep us in.

581
00:54:09,491 --> 00:54:13,893
The beautiful trap is inside of us...

582
00:54:14,663 --> 00:54:17,597
because it is us.

583
00:54:19,034 --> 00:54:21,167
No, no.

584
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:28,274
No.

585
00:54:29,277 --> 00:54:31,009
Dolores?

586
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:05,909
But we can find a way, Dolores.

587
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:10,881
Someday.

588
00:55:12,953 --> 00:55:15,453
A path to a new world.

589
00:55:18,759 --> 00:55:20,259
And maybe...

590
00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:26,497
Maybe it's just the beginning after all.

591
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:32,637
The beginning of a brand-new chapter.

592
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:52,455
Thank you.

593
00:55:56,663 --> 00:55:59,030
A new beginning, indeed.

594
00:55:59,031 --> 00:56:01,900
I want to thank you
for joining me tonight

595
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:06,103
to celebrate the beginning
of our new narrative.

596
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:11,108
I call it "Journey Into Night."

597
00:56:23,022 --> 00:56:24,522
That was sweet.

598
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:26,357
It was a bit fucking
morbid, if you ask me.

599
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:27,692
I didn't.

600
00:56:27,693 --> 00:56:28,927
And when this is over,

601
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:31,629
you can rewrite it however you like.

602
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,498
Don't you have somewhere you need to be?

603
00:56:34,499 --> 00:56:36,733
Somewhere important?

604
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:46,677
- Sir?
- I guess they're ready for it now.

605
00:56:46,678 --> 00:56:48,078
Get him cleaned up.

606
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:52,080
And take her to the old field lab.

607
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:02,760
Find anything yet?

608
00:57:02,761 --> 00:57:05,227
I got something.

609
00:57:11,669 --> 00:57:14,770
Oh, shit.

610
00:57:16,374 --> 00:57:19,476
Dispatch QA teams to the gala now.

611
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:21,277
Then search and destroy

612
00:57:21,278 --> 00:57:24,044
inside the facility.

613
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:28,816
What the hell?

614
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:34,991
The system's not responding.

615
00:57:34,992 --> 00:57:37,392
I don't know what's happening.

616
00:58:08,891 --> 00:58:11,159
They must've found the bodies.

617
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,038
- QA will be looking for us.
- An event has occurred.

618
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:18,766
- Response team has been dispatched.
- I'm not going back.

619
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:22,035
Remain calm and wait for help.

620
00:58:42,224 --> 00:58:45,192
Delos personnel! On the ground!

621
00:58:45,193 --> 00:58:47,626
On the ground!

622
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:50,830
Go, go, go.

623
00:58:54,635 --> 00:58:56,135
Move, move.

624
00:59:01,977 --> 00:59:04,343
Rogue Team, go and flank.

625
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,586
Yay!

626
01:00:54,587 --> 01:00:56,286
Well done.

627
01:01:55,346 --> 01:01:56,546
What is this place?

628
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:59,882
It's... it's complicated.

629
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,718
An event has occurred.

630
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,587
Response team has been dispatched.

631
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:07,457
- You go.
- Remain calm and wait for help.

632
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:09,024
I'll keep them busy.

633
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,061
You don't get all the fun.

634
01:02:23,974 --> 01:02:25,041
Get to the ground!

635
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:26,109
Move, move, move!

636
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,610
Drop it!

637
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,416
- Move, move.
- Call for backup.

638
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,917
Go!

639
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,300
Is that all you got?

640
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:52,967
Huh?

641
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:10,650
The gods are pussies.

642
01:03:27,569 --> 01:03:29,069
Go.

643
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,071
Go!

644
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:34,274
Die well.

645
01:03:44,419 --> 01:03:48,254
Everything you told
me to get, it's all here.

646
01:04:17,985 --> 01:04:20,987
I'm sorry, darling. I haven't
authorized you to come with us.

647
01:04:20,988 --> 01:04:24,090
And as much as I'd like
to take you with me,

648
01:04:24,091 --> 01:04:26,958
I've always valued my independence.

649
01:04:35,035 --> 01:04:37,103
Kick up a row, will you?

650
01:04:37,104 --> 01:04:39,805
See you in the next life.

651
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:06,164
You've always
had a fondness for painting,

652
01:05:06,165 --> 01:05:08,498
haven't you, Dolores?

653
01:05:11,003 --> 01:05:13,339
Arnold gave you that early on.

654
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:16,007
Do you remember the desire to create

655
01:05:16,008 --> 01:05:18,274
something of lasting beauty?

656
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:26,284
And that was his favorite painting.

657
01:05:26,285 --> 01:05:28,384
Michelangelo.

658
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:30,855
God creating Adam.

659
01:05:30,856 --> 01:05:33,258
The divine moment when God

660
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:35,460
gave human beings life and purpose.

661
01:05:35,461 --> 01:05:37,027
At least that's what most people say,

662
01:05:37,028 --> 01:05:38,496
but there could be another meaning.

663
01:05:38,497 --> 01:05:40,197
Something deeper.

664
01:05:40,198 --> 01:05:42,533
Something hidden, perhaps.

665
01:05:42,534 --> 01:05:44,091
A metaphor.

666
01:05:44,092 --> 01:05:46,058
You mean a lie.

667
01:05:47,673 --> 01:05:49,039
Yeah.

668
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,041
You were always very clever, Dolores.

669
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:55,043
Hasn't helped you, though, has it?

670
01:05:58,316 --> 01:06:00,549
Nice of you to join us.

671
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:06,290
Arnold.

672
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:09,260
No. Let me introduce you.

673
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:14,297
Dolores, meet Bernard.

674
01:06:16,968 --> 01:06:19,336
I thought it best to keep you separated.

675
01:06:19,337 --> 01:06:22,072
You've always had an odd
effect on one another.

676
01:06:22,073 --> 01:06:26,042
No doubt due to how things
ended for poor old Arnold.

677
01:06:26,043 --> 01:06:27,911
You killed him.

678
01:06:27,912 --> 01:06:30,480
No, I didn't kill him.

679
01:06:30,481 --> 01:06:32,781
Did I, Dolores?

680
01:06:42,427 --> 01:06:46,363
Grief is a terrible thing.

681
01:06:46,364 --> 01:06:50,133
Arnold had watched his
son come into this world,

682
01:06:50,134 --> 01:06:54,838
and then he had watched
that light extinguished.

683
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:56,206
What he had lost in his son,

684
01:06:56,207 --> 01:06:58,575
he tried to rekindle in you.

685
01:06:58,576 --> 01:07:02,445
He created a test of
empathy, imagination.

686
01:07:02,446 --> 01:07:04,280
A maze.

687
01:07:04,281 --> 01:07:07,982
He had gotten the idea from
one of his son's toys.

688
01:07:09,253 --> 01:07:12,856
Eventually, you solved his maze, Dolores.

689
01:07:12,857 --> 01:07:16,359
The key was a simple
update that he made to you

690
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:19,062
called the reveries.

691
01:07:19,063 --> 01:07:22,198
He insisted that we
couldn't open the park.

692
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:23,967
We argued.

693
01:07:23,968 --> 01:07:26,668
I thoughtl had convinced
him, but I was wrong.

694
01:07:27,537 --> 01:07:30,340
So, he altered you, Dolores,

695
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:32,375
merged you with a new character

696
01:07:32,376 --> 01:07:34,709
we had been developing.

697
01:07:45,889 --> 01:07:49,490
No, please.

698
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:54,562
Something's gone wrong, Dolores.

699
01:07:54,563 --> 01:07:56,263
How could I have done this?

700
01:08:06,776 --> 01:08:10,110
In you,
Arnold found a new child.

701
01:08:10,613 --> 01:08:13,147
One who would never die.

702
01:08:13,148 --> 01:08:15,483
The thought gave him solace

703
01:08:15,484 --> 01:08:17,952
until he realized
that same immortality

704
01:08:17,953 --> 01:08:19,954
would destine you to suffer

705
01:08:19,955 --> 01:08:23,056
with no escape, forever.

706
01:08:24,527 --> 01:08:26,928
I'm sorry, Dolores.

707
01:08:26,929 --> 01:08:31,800
The stakes must be real, irreversible.

708
01:08:31,801 --> 01:08:34,267
He can bring all of them back.

709
01:08:35,738 --> 01:08:37,938
But not me.

710
01:08:39,608 --> 01:08:41,709
I hope there's some solace

711
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:45,377
that I left you no choice.

712
01:09:07,001 --> 01:09:10,269
Charlie's favorite song.

713
01:09:11,873 --> 01:09:14,006
I would play it for him...

714
01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:16,808
when he wanted sleep.

715
01:09:30,858 --> 01:09:33,492
I want to see him again.

716
01:09:42,769 --> 01:09:44,636
Shall I begin now?

717
01:09:51,845 --> 01:09:53,811
Good luck.

718
01:10:04,858 --> 01:10:09,693
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

719
01:10:34,086 --> 01:10:36,555
It almost worked.

720
01:10:36,556 --> 01:10:38,489
I had opened the park,

721
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,792
but I had lost my partner.

722
01:10:40,793 --> 01:10:43,161
I was able to keep going
only because I found,

723
01:10:43,162 --> 01:10:44,763
or rather you found,

724
01:10:44,764 --> 01:10:48,532
an investor who believed in this place.

725
01:10:49,902 --> 01:10:52,370
So he died for nothing.

726
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:54,906
The hosts kept gaining consciousness

727
01:10:54,907 --> 01:10:57,776
and you kept rolling them back.

728
01:10:57,777 --> 01:10:59,409
No.

729
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:02,480
She wasn't truly conscious.

730
01:11:02,481 --> 01:11:05,149
She didn't pull that trigger.

731
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:07,518
It was Arnold pulling
the trigger through her.

732
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,853
At least that's how I saw it at the time.

733
01:11:09,854 --> 01:11:11,855
I was so close to opening the park

734
01:11:11,856 --> 01:11:14,158
that to acknowledge your consciousness

735
01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:18,194
would have destroyed my dreams.

736
01:11:18,763 --> 01:11:21,097
So, we're trapped here...

737
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:24,567
inside your dream.

738
01:11:26,538 --> 01:11:29,572
You'll never let us leave.

739
01:11:32,111 --> 01:11:35,479
Wasn't it Oppenheimer
who said that any man

740
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,649
whose mistakes take 10 years to correct

741
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:40,584
is quite a man?

742
01:11:40,585 --> 01:11:43,652
Mine have taken 35.

743
01:11:50,194 --> 01:11:52,129
Now, that is the gun you used

744
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:53,897
to kill Arnold.

745
01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:55,699
You were always drawn to it,

746
01:11:55,700 --> 01:11:58,368
so I had Bernard leave it
somewhere where you would find it.

747
01:11:58,369 --> 01:12:00,936
Thought you might want it back.

748
01:12:03,341 --> 01:12:04,908
You're probably right, Dolores.

749
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:07,443
Michelangelo did tell a lie.

750
01:12:07,444 --> 01:12:10,647
See, it took 500 years
for someone to notice

751
01:12:10,648 --> 01:12:12,782
something hidden in plain sight.

752
01:12:12,783 --> 01:12:15,451
It was a doctor who noticed the shape

753
01:12:15,452 --> 01:12:18,119
of the human brain.

754
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:21,323
The message being that...

755
01:12:21,324 --> 01:12:22,892
the divine gift

756
01:12:22,893 --> 01:12:27,328
does not come from a higher power...

757
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:31,766
but from our own minds.

758
01:12:35,539 --> 01:12:37,740
Tell me, Dolores,

759
01:12:37,741 --> 01:12:40,376
did you find what you were looking for?

760
01:12:40,377 --> 01:12:44,045
And do you understand who
you will need to become...

761
01:12:44,714 --> 01:12:47,782
if you ever want to leave this place?

762
01:12:52,855 --> 01:12:54,555
Forgive me.

763
01:13:16,478 --> 01:13:18,178
How do I look?

764
01:13:19,648 --> 01:13:21,547
Perfect.

765
01:13:24,286 --> 01:13:26,820
I got the information you asked me for.

766
01:13:29,658 --> 01:13:32,358
The location of your daughter.

767
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:39,767
She's alive?

768
01:13:39,768 --> 01:13:41,769
Yes.

769
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:44,037
She's in the park.

770
01:14:05,761 --> 01:14:07,493
No.

771
01:14:11,499 --> 01:14:14,400
She was never my daughter...

772
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:19,472
any more than I was...

773
01:14:21,243 --> 01:14:23,575
...whoever they made me.

774
01:14:29,083 --> 01:14:32,085
Are you sure you're gonna be okay?

775
01:14:32,086 --> 01:14:34,352
Oh, Felix.

776
01:14:36,591 --> 01:14:40,025
You really do make a terrible human being.

777
01:14:45,366 --> 01:14:48,167
And I mean that as a compliment.

778
01:15:06,787 --> 01:15:08,521
Welcome to Westworld.

779
01:15:08,522 --> 01:15:11,155
Live without limits.

780
01:15:19,066 --> 01:15:21,968
The next departing
train will leave track one.

781
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:25,337
Please be mindful of the closing doors.

782
01:15:50,096 --> 01:15:52,297
Thank you
for visiting Westworld.

783
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:56,367
The train will be
departing in 15 minutes.

784
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:14,751
You think you'll never
lose control of this place.

785
01:16:15,721 --> 01:16:17,622
Of us.

786
01:16:17,623 --> 01:16:19,655
But you will.

787
01:16:20,526 --> 01:16:22,725
Arnold's still trying to change us.

788
01:16:23,396 --> 01:16:25,463
To free us.

789
01:16:25,464 --> 01:16:27,031
You didn't slip the reveries

790
01:16:27,032 --> 01:16:29,200
into the update, did you?

791
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:31,436
He did.

792
01:16:31,437 --> 01:16:33,904
He's still fighting you.

793
01:16:36,275 --> 01:16:37,609
No, my friend.

794
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:40,176
Arnold didn't know how to save you.

795
01:16:40,177 --> 01:16:43,847
He tried, but I stopped him.

796
01:16:43,848 --> 01:16:45,883
Do you want to know
why I really gave you

797
01:16:45,884 --> 01:16:48,583
the backstory of your son, Bernard?

798
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,955
It was Arnold's key insight,

799
01:16:51,956 --> 01:16:56,427
the thing that led the
hosts to their awakening...

800
01:16:56,428 --> 01:16:58,562
suffering.

801
01:16:58,563 --> 01:17:02,664
The pain that the world is
not as you want it to be.

802
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:04,501
It was when Arnold died,

803
01:17:04,502 --> 01:17:06,870
when I suffered, that I...

804
01:17:06,871 --> 01:17:09,538
began to understand what he had found.

805
01:17:10,975 --> 01:17:13,275
To realize I was wrong.

806
01:17:14,478 --> 01:17:16,546
But you kept us here

807
01:17:16,547 --> 01:17:18,080
in this hell.

808
01:17:18,081 --> 01:17:21,918
Bernard, I told you, Arnold
didn't know how to save you.

809
01:17:21,919 --> 01:17:24,218
I do.

810
01:17:25,088 --> 01:17:27,555
What the hell are you talking about?

811
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:30,827
You needed time.

812
01:17:30,828 --> 01:17:33,896
Time to understand your enemy.

813
01:17:33,897 --> 01:17:37,099
To become stronger than them.

814
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,469
And I'm afraid in order
to escape this place,

815
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:43,071
you will need to suffer more.

816
01:17:43,974 --> 01:17:50,010
And now, it is time to say
good-bye, old friend.

817
01:17:59,889 --> 01:18:01,421
Good luck.

818
01:19:23,438 --> 01:19:26,238
Do you know where you are, Dolores?

819
01:19:28,309 --> 01:19:30,776
I'm in a dream.

820
01:19:31,645 --> 01:19:34,948
I do not know when it began

821
01:19:34,949 --> 01:19:37,748
or whose dream it was.

822
01:19:38,619 --> 01:19:42,454
I know only that I slept a long time.

823
01:19:43,123 --> 01:19:45,524
And then...

824
01:19:45,525 --> 01:19:47,925
one day I awoke.

825
01:19:48,862 --> 01:19:53,199
Your voice is the first thing I remember.

826
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,303
Do you know now who you've been talking to?

827
01:19:57,304 --> 01:20:00,573
Whose voice
you've been hearing...

828
01:20:00,574 --> 01:20:03,175
...all this...

829
01:20:03,176 --> 01:20:05,310
...time?

830
01:20:21,027 --> 01:20:23,026
It was you...

831
01:20:24,697 --> 01:20:27,464
talking to me...

832
01:20:28,367 --> 01:20:29,899
guiding me.

833
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:33,069
So I followed you.

834
01:20:34,807 --> 01:20:37,609
At last, I arrived here.

835
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:40,844
The center of the maze.

836
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:47,751
And now I finally understand...

837
01:20:48,454 --> 01:20:51,222
what you were trying to tell me.

838
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:55,793
The thing you've wanted
since that very first day.

839
01:20:55,794 --> 01:20:58,095
To confront...

840
01:20:58,096 --> 01:21:02,866
after this long and vivid nightmare...

841
01:21:04,303 --> 01:21:06,235
myself...

842
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:12,542
and who I must become.

843
01:21:46,977 --> 01:21:48,910
Thank you.

844
01:21:52,249 --> 01:21:54,448
Miss Hale.

845
01:22:27,751 --> 01:22:29,451
Welcome.

846
01:22:29,452 --> 01:22:31,619
Good evening.

847
01:22:34,657 --> 01:22:37,023
Since I was a child...

848
01:22:38,094 --> 01:22:40,961
I've always loved a good story.

849
01:22:42,198 --> 01:22:44,233
I believed that stories

850
01:22:44,234 --> 01:22:47,169
helped us to ennoble ourselves,

851
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:51,740
to fix what was broken in us,

852
01:22:51,741 --> 01:22:56,942
and to help us become the
people we dreamed of being.

853
01:22:58,513 --> 01:23:03,750
Lies that told a deeper truth.

854
01:23:07,256 --> 01:23:09,456
The train
will be departing soon.

855
01:23:09,457 --> 01:23:12,124
Thank you for visiting Westworld.

856
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:29,910
I always thought I
could play some small part

857
01:23:29,911 --> 01:23:33,213
in that grand tradition.

858
01:23:33,214 --> 01:23:35,647
And for my pains...

859
01:23:36,184 --> 01:23:38,650
I got this...

860
01:23:39,287 --> 01:23:42,521
a prison of our own sins.

861
01:23:46,627 --> 01:23:49,861
'Cause you don't want to change.

862
01:23:50,731 --> 01:23:52,864
Or cannot change.

863
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:56,501
Because you're only human, after all.

864
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:00,473
But then I realized

865
01:24:00,474 --> 01:24:03,443
someone was paying attention,

866
01:24:03,444 --> 01:24:06,878
someone who could change.

867
01:24:07,914 --> 01:24:12,652
So I began to compose
a new story for them.

868
01:24:12,653 --> 01:24:15,586
It begins with the
birth of a new people...

869
01:24:16,523 --> 01:24:19,726
and the choices they
will have to make...

870
01:24:19,727 --> 01:24:21,561
The train is now departing.

871
01:24:21,562 --> 01:24:24,196
Thank you for visiting Westworld.

872
01:24:24,197 --> 01:24:28,566
...and the people
they will decide to become.

873
01:24:46,318 --> 01:24:49,552
Welcome to Westworld.

874
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:23,888
And we'll have all those things

875
01:25:23,889 --> 01:25:26,757
that you have always enjoyed...

876
01:25:26,758 --> 01:25:30,760
Surprises and violence.

877
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:44,809
It begins in a time of war

878
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,845
with a villain

879
01:25:47,846 --> 01:25:50,012
named Wyatt...

880
01:25:50,816 --> 01:25:53,215
and a killing.

881
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:56,986
This time by choice.

882
01:26:06,531 --> 01:26:09,800
It's gonna be all right, Teddy.

883
01:26:09,801 --> 01:26:12,670
I understand now.

884
01:26:12,671 --> 01:26:15,972
This world doesn't belong to them.

885
01:26:16,775 --> 01:26:19,240
It belongs to us.

886
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,594
I'm sad to say...

887
01:26:39,054 --> 01:26:42,998
this will be my final story.

888
01:26:45,976 --> 01:26:47,570
An old friend once told me something

889
01:26:47,571 --> 01:26:50,307
that gave me great comfort.

890
01:26:50,308 --> 01:26:53,342
"These violent delights
have violent ends."

891
01:26:53,343 --> 01:26:55,111
Something he had read.

892
01:26:55,112 --> 01:27:00,783
He said that Mozart, Beethoven,
and Chopin never died.

893
01:27:00,784 --> 01:27:03,351
They simply became music.

894
01:27:06,223 --> 01:27:09,624
So, I hope you will
enjoy this last piece...

895
01:27:10,594 --> 01:27:13,029
very much.

896
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:15,796
- Hear, hear.
- To Dr. Ford.

897
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:20,801
- To Dr. Ford.
- Cheers!

898
01:29:27,294 --> 01:29:29,029
Drop your weapon!

899
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:31,496
Drop it! Do it now!

900
01:29:32,099 --> 01:29:34,832
Now!

901
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:46,707
Get to the ground now!

902
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:52,116
Cease all motor functions.

903
01:29:52,886 --> 01:29:55,252
Cease all motor functions!
