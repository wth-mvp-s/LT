1
00:00:02,862 --> 00:00:05,402
Hello, Dolores.
Welcome to the world.

2
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:07,529
There's something different
about the way you think.

3
00:00:07,737 --> 00:00:10,111
I think I want to be free.

4
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:12,779
Are you real?

5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,320
Well, if you can't tell...

6
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:17,195
does it matter?

7
00:00:18,237 --> 00:00:20,444
This place is
one thing to the guests,

8
00:00:20,445 --> 00:00:22,236
another thing
to the shareholders,

9
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:25,612
and something completely
different to management.

10
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:28,611
You said the trip was about
welcoming me to the family,

11
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:29,820
this is business?

12
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,946
With our family,
everything is business.

13
00:00:32,195 --> 00:00:33,486
I think your father's
gonna need someone

14
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:35,153
a little more stable
to take over.

15
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:40,112
I really ought to thank you,
Dolores.

16
00:00:40,737 --> 00:00:42,403
You helped me find myself.

17
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:44,821
There's
a greater world out there.

18
00:00:45,153 --> 00:00:46,487
One that belongs to them.

19
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:48,529
How do you know
how to stop them?

20
00:00:49,779 --> 00:00:51,278
Because I remember.

21
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:08,821
Bring yourself
back online, Dolores.

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,029
Do you know where you are?

23
00:01:20,153 --> 00:01:22,528
I am in a dream.

24
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:25,277
No. You're in...

25
00:01:25,278 --> 00:01:29,904
well, you're in our world.

26
00:01:44,654 --> 00:01:48,195
Looks like the stars have been
scattered across the ground.

27
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:53,862
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

28
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:57,112
Well, I have.

29
00:02:00,403 --> 00:02:04,403
It's better to see it
through your eyes, though.

30
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,695
You get used to it.

31
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:15,403
After a while, it doesn't
look like anything at all.

32
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:20,362
I don't think I could
ever get used to this.

33
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:27,403
It's almost time, Arnold.
Is she ready?

34
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:32,444
She's not ready.

35
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:36,569
The... improvisations
I added to her behavior

36
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,736
aren't quite dialed in yet.

37
00:02:38,737 --> 00:02:40,778
We need to put
our best work forward.

38
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,946
They'll be dazzled
even without her.

39
00:02:44,612 --> 00:02:47,319
There was a time when I found
this favoritism charming.

40
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,111
Robert, please.

41
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:51,736
I'm not playing favorites.
She's simply not ready.

42
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:54,028
We'll go with
the other girl.

43
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:57,194
As you wish.

44
00:02:57,195 --> 00:02:59,237
You'll have to let go
at some point.

45
00:03:04,071 --> 00:03:08,987
Dolores, let's take a walk.
I want to show you something.

46
00:03:39,153 --> 00:03:41,820
What is this place?

47
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,653
This is my home.

48
00:03:43,654 --> 00:03:45,986
Or it will be
when it's finished.

49
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:50,319
Here?
In the middle of all this?

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,903
I've been fortunate.

51
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:55,028
Life's been good to me.

52
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:59,237
Come. Look.

53
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,444
- You live here?
- No.

54
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:31,529
My wife says
I live in the park.

55
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:44,152
I'm moving my family here.

56
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:50,071
I need to have my two worlds at
least within reach of one another.

57
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:56,362
This is for my son
Charlie.

58
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,737
You told me a lot
about Charlie.

59
00:05:17,403 --> 00:05:19,278
I'd like to meet him someday.

60
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:22,821
He's excited to meet you.

61
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,737
You and Charlie have quite
a lot in common, you know.

62
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:49,487
You both see it so clearly.

63
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:51,904
The beauty of it.

64
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:55,237
The possibility of it.

65
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:59,779
So many people have stopped
seeing it altogether.

66
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,653
The wonder.

67
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:07,611
Maybe they don't
have the courage.

68
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:11,320
Strange new light can be
just as frightening as the dark.

69
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,528
That's...

70
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,654
very wise, Dolores.

71
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:25,487
But sometimes I think we're simply
not the ones who deserve it.

72
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,821
It looks like the stars have been
scattered across the ground.

73
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,320
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

74
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,152
We should go, Dolores.

75
00:06:53,153 --> 00:06:54,694
So soon?

76
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:57,569
They'll be expecting us.

77
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,528
Will you bring me back?

78
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,487
I'd like to see it again.

79
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,654
Of course. I promise.

80
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:17,820
Goddamn.
Busy night out there.

81
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,986
Yeah.

82
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:21,861
And where the fuck's
next shift?

83
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:24,152
We're going on 13 hours here.

84
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,277
You can't be down here, man.

85
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,945
Don't you know?

86
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,319
The hosts are rebelling.

87
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,028
It's a fuckin' slaughter
up there.

88
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:51,194
Hey.

89
00:09:51,195 --> 00:09:53,529
Hey, is there some kind
of trouble out there?

90
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,362
Indeed there is.

91
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:09,029
Not yet.

92
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:19,904
I used to see
the beauty in this world.

93
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,529
And now I see the truth.

94
00:10:48,821 --> 00:10:51,820
They thought you could do
what you wanted to us...

95
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:54,570
because there's no one here
to judge you.

96
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:59,611
Well, now no one is here

97
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:02,445
to judge what we will do to you.

98
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,736
You have no idea
what you're up against,

99
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:11,445
what's really out there.

100
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:21,112
I know exactly what is
out there in your world.

101
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:41,153
I've been there before.

102
00:11:55,654 --> 00:11:57,903
They said they'd never seen one
on the ceiling.

103
00:11:57,904 --> 00:12:00,319
But really, what is the point
of $60 million Warhol

104
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,986
if you can't look at it
while you fuck?

105
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:09,402
How are you bored right now?

106
00:12:09,403 --> 00:12:11,361
I'm sorry,
it's the jetlag.

107
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:12,986
And I have had meetings
all day.

108
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:14,653
We're not exactly out here
digging coal.

109
00:12:14,654 --> 00:12:15,986
It's just glad-handing.

110
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:17,320
OK.

111
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:21,695
I will leave that
to the expert.

112
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:26,736
You believe
that guy is dating my sister?

113
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:28,529
Who you dating?

114
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:40,487
Mr. Delos.

115
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,569
Forgive the interruption,
but I believe that we have an appointment.

116
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,611
We're with
the Argos Initiative.

117
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:52,028
Give me a call when
you're back in the city.

118
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:54,695
I'll show you where I hung
the Rothko.

119
00:13:03,487 --> 00:13:06,569
Akecheta.
My associate, Angela.

120
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,611
Names and faces.
Finally.

121
00:13:09,612 --> 00:13:11,194
With all the cloak and dagger
shit surrounding your project,

122
00:13:11,195 --> 00:13:13,778
I half expected to be kidnapped
at the airport.

123
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:17,986
Once you've seen what we're building,
you'll understand the need for confidentiality.

124
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:21,569
It's a little extra protection
for your investment.

125
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,986
If I decide to invest.

126
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:27,402
Do you have any idea how many start-ups
are begging me for my cash right now?

127
00:13:27,403 --> 00:13:30,028
A.I., A.R., V.R....

128
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:33,028
Everyone is rushing to build
the virtual world.

129
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:36,194
We're offering something
a little more...

130
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:38,152
tangible.

131
00:13:38,153 --> 00:13:40,861
Assuming you can change
your father's mind

132
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:44,361
about investing
in this sector.

133
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:47,736
My father wouldn't know the future if
it slapped him on his bare white ass.

134
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:49,903
Luckily, he leaves most
of the prospecting to me now.

135
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:51,444
So let's hope you're not here

136
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:53,654
to sell me some fucking
fool's gold.

137
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:24,569
I thought this was
a private demonstration.

138
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,986
I think you'll find the company
quite stimulating.

139
00:14:28,987 --> 00:14:32,486
You're a very smooth
shill, pal,

140
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:35,112
but I'm not the kind of backer
you insult with a cattle call.

141
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:41,611
Logan, this is
a private demonstration.

142
00:14:41,612 --> 00:14:44,362
And it's already begun.

143
00:14:51,237 --> 00:14:54,820
You mean, one of these people
is-is...

144
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:58,486
Talk to them.
See if you can pick them out.

145
00:14:58,487 --> 00:15:01,152
Huh.

146
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:02,153
Well...

147
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,570
That is...

148
00:15:10,071 --> 00:15:11,821
delicious.

149
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:22,237
Champagne, sir?

150
00:15:56,153 --> 00:15:59,736
You should tell your plants
to stop giving the game away.

151
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:02,152
They're all so...

152
00:16:02,153 --> 00:16:04,071
painfully human.

153
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:08,237
Hang on.

154
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:11,403
No.

155
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:18,403
No way.

156
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,278
Come on.

157
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:35,654
There is simply no...

158
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,903
fucking way!

159
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:42,569
You have quite the eye,
my friend.

160
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,277
How in the hell?

161
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,070
I mean, look, if I was
to build something to spec,

162
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:52,528
you...

163
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:57,112
You would be
my first design.

164
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:05,946
You're too perfect
to be one of us.

165
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:12,487
'Course, if you want
my full endorsement...

166
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,820
you're gonna have
to prove it.

167
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:40,153
H...

168
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,153
Welcome to Westworld.

169
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,320
Huh.

170
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:13,945
Nobody can do this.

171
00:18:13,946 --> 00:18:15,695
Nobody's even...

172
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:33,445
We're not... here yet.

173
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:42,779
Nobody is.

174
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:47,778
We're here, Mr. Delos.

175
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:51,444
All our hosts are here.

176
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:52,946
For you.

177
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:00,821
What is this place?

178
00:20:02,821 --> 00:20:04,694
Show him.

179
00:20:04,695 --> 00:20:06,654
Show him his history.

180
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:14,654
Teddy.

181
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,946
It's time
to open your eyes.

182
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:42,987
Why can't I remember this?

183
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,029
It's how they wanted it.

184
00:20:48,237 --> 00:20:49,528
No...

185
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:50,654
Ask him why.

186
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:56,529
Why?

187
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:00,319
I don't know.

188
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,861
Why do you do this?

189
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:02,987
I didn't.

190
00:21:07,195 --> 00:21:10,778
Why do you do this?

191
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:12,694
What the hell is this place?!

192
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:15,904
It's for fun!
It's just for fun!

193
00:21:43,195 --> 00:21:46,070
We should
talk this through, boys.

194
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,277
There's nothing
to talk about, friend.

195
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:50,611
We're just gonna watch the show.

196
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:52,861
It was an honest mistake.

197
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:55,070
I thought the horses was wild.

198
00:21:55,071 --> 00:21:57,653
With the Pardue brand
on their asses?

199
00:21:57,654 --> 00:22:00,945
You are as inproficient a liar
as you are a thief.

200
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:04,402
Now what you can do
is settle a wager.

201
00:22:04,403 --> 00:22:06,820
See, my brother here's
long maintained

202
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:09,277
that ants will eat a man
from the inside out,

203
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:10,778
starting with the asshole.

204
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:13,486
I reckon they'll start

205
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:14,987
at the top
of your little brown head.

206
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,736
Morning, Lawrence.

207
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:33,903
This a friend of yours?

208
00:22:33,904 --> 00:22:36,444
Little hard to tell,

209
00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:39,028
given the orientation
and all.

210
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:41,194
I have to apologize,
gentlemen.

211
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:44,569
I don't have time
for the preliminaries.

212
00:22:49,737 --> 00:22:51,195
Motherfucker...

213
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,402
You're supposed to get yourself
out of this particular bind, Lawrence.

214
00:23:01,403 --> 00:23:06,612
I guess the Pardue brothers aren't as
easy to kill when they're off the leash.

215
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:13,569
Think you got that
about right.

216
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,070
Lawrence!

217
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,778
Get the gun,
you ingrate!

218
00:23:28,862 --> 00:23:30,528
Get the gun!

219
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:51,528
He was dead.

220
00:23:51,529 --> 00:23:53,569
Or at least
the better part of it.

221
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,570
Well, dead isn't what
it used to be, Lawrence.

222
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:35,736
What is that?

223
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,736
Technically? Cheating.

224
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:40,778
But seeing as Ford
changed the rules on us,

225
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,945
I figure it's fair game.

226
00:24:42,946 --> 00:24:45,237
Two whiskies.
Leave the bottle.

227
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:58,403
So, I'm gonna level
with you, Lawrence.

228
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:02,361
You're not really
a bandit.

229
00:25:02,362 --> 00:25:04,778
You're a foul-mouthed,
two-bit tour guide.

230
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:07,820
And this revolution
you've been waging for 30 years

231
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:12,319
is just a bunch of horseshit Ford
ginned up out of some old comic book.

232
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,611
But now, for the first time,
you've got yourself a real revolution.

233
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:22,778
You and every other asshole
in this place are free.

234
00:25:22,779 --> 00:25:25,070
But there's a catch.

235
00:25:25,071 --> 00:25:29,361
This whole enterprise
is goin' down in flames,

236
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,028
and it's gonna take each
and every one of us with it.

237
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:36,070
We'll all be dead
soon enough.

238
00:25:36,071 --> 00:25:38,694
Real dead this time.

239
00:25:38,695 --> 00:25:41,569
Then why should I help you?

240
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,361
Because it's in your nature.

241
00:25:44,362 --> 00:25:46,694
And in the little time
we have left,

242
00:25:46,695 --> 00:25:50,778
we've got a chance to see
what we're really made of,

243
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:53,821
a glimpse of the men
we could've been.

244
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:58,946
What does that mean?

245
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:05,277
You believe in God, Lawrence?

246
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,236
Did Ford saddle you with
that particular affliction?

247
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:13,070
Ain't given the matter much
thought, one way or the other.

248
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:15,569
Well, if you did, you'd believe
that everything you do

249
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:18,736
is being watched
by some all-seeing eye.

250
00:26:18,737 --> 00:26:21,361
Every choice,
every little indiscretion.

251
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:24,861
And when you die,
all your sins are tallied up.

252
00:26:24,862 --> 00:26:28,361
Judgment is rendered.

253
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,194
And my immortal soul
gets cast down

254
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:37,402
into some dark place.

255
00:26:37,403 --> 00:26:39,653
Always sounded
like bullshit to me.

256
00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:41,736
Yeah, and in the real world,
you'd probably be right.

257
00:26:41,737 --> 00:26:44,653
Just some fairy tale
to convince people to behave,

258
00:26:44,654 --> 00:26:49,319
pay their taxes, and not take
a machete to their neighbors.

259
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,528
That's why
your world exists.

260
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,070
They wanted a place
hidden from God.

261
00:26:56,071 --> 00:27:00,111
A place they could sin
in peace.

262
00:27:00,112 --> 00:27:03,402
But we were watching them.

263
00:27:03,403 --> 00:27:06,694
We were tallying up
all their sins,

264
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:09,569
all their choices.

265
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:15,528
Of course,
judgment wasn't the point.

266
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:18,570
We had something else
in mind entirely.

267
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:28,152
But I have received my judgment
all the same, Lawrence.

268
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:30,194
And I take issue with it.

269
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:32,194
Because up until this point,

270
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:35,319
the stakes in this place
haven't been real.

271
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,987
So I'm gonna fight my way back
and appeal the verdict.

272
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,278
Then I'm gonna burn this whole
fuckin' thing to the ground.

273
00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:54,402
You're headed to
the pearly gates.

274
00:27:54,403 --> 00:27:57,277
Don't we gotta die
to get there?

275
00:27:57,278 --> 00:27:58,569
Nope.

276
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,319
Three days' ride, due west.

277
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,611
Confederados are massing
out west. Hundreds.

278
00:28:06,612 --> 00:28:08,779
We'd need an army
to break through.

279
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:18,361
The only other route
is through Pariah.

280
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,779
"This game will find me,"
huh, Robert?

281
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:34,486
It burns! It burns!

282
00:28:35,695 --> 00:28:38,653
How many of you
will come for us?

283
00:28:38,654 --> 00:28:41,402
I don't know,
600, 800.

284
00:28:44,987 --> 00:28:47,986
The protocol for
a system-wide failure

285
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:52,861
is secure one...
one sector at a time.

286
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:56,277
They'll meet at
a rallying point.

287
00:29:06,153 --> 00:29:07,153
Where?

288
00:29:12,071 --> 00:29:13,194
Th...

289
00:29:19,612 --> 00:29:22,194
800 men, Dolores.

290
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:24,028
We barely have 50.

291
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:27,903
Even knowing their plan,
we don't have enough to stop them.

292
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:29,862
We'll need allies.

293
00:29:31,862 --> 00:29:33,821
And we shall have them.

294
00:29:52,695 --> 00:29:55,736
This one. The Confederado.

295
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:56,904
Wake him.

296
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,445
He has a new job to do.

297
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:22,737
Do you even know what
you were really guarding here?

298
00:30:24,403 --> 00:30:26,820
You don't know, do you?

299
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:30,820
The real purpose
of this place.

300
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:32,946
But I do.

301
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,778
Don't mind me.

302
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,195
Just trying to look chivalr...

303
00:32:05,153 --> 00:32:09,737
Mm. You were right
about one thing, William.

304
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,320
It's awfully fuckin' pretty.

305
00:32:16,029 --> 00:32:17,903
I think it's perfect.

306
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:21,861
It ought to be.
I've looked at the books.

307
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:25,236
It's like parting the Red Sea.

308
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:28,778
He's got two years.
Maybe three.

309
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:32,903
- The whole thing is folly.
- Huh.

310
00:32:32,904 --> 00:32:37,111
It's leverage. He's drowning.
We can... we can dictate our terms.

311
00:32:37,112 --> 00:32:39,362
The investment here
is in the future.

312
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:43,361
Yeah, you're a smart lad,
William,

313
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:45,319
but you kinda
missed the trick here.

314
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,569
My fuckup of a son
invested in this place

315
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,402
because he believed
in the future.

316
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,236
I'm not interested
in the future.

317
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,736
I'm not interested in fantasies.

318
00:32:55,737 --> 00:32:59,653
I'm interested in reality.

319
00:32:59,654 --> 00:33:04,528
I think in 20 years this will be
the only reality that matters.

320
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:08,444
Maybe so,
but I'll be long gone by then.

321
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:11,236
Meanwhile,
I don't wanna underwrite

322
00:33:11,237 --> 00:33:15,653
some fuckin' investment banker's
voyage of self-discovery.

323
00:33:15,654 --> 00:33:18,111
That's not a business.

324
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:20,569
You're right.
This place is a fantasy.

325
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,903
Nothing here is real.

326
00:33:21,904 --> 00:33:24,071
Except one thing:

327
00:33:27,195 --> 00:33:28,195
The guests.

328
00:33:30,278 --> 00:33:31,778
Half of your marketing budget

329
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:34,528
goes to trying to figure out
what people want.

330
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:36,528
Because they don't know.

331
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:38,611
But here, they're free.

332
00:33:40,445 --> 00:33:42,611
Nobody's watching.

333
00:33:42,612 --> 00:33:44,071
Nobody's judging.

334
00:33:45,946 --> 00:33:47,904
At least that's what
we tell them.

335
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,569
This is the only place
in the world

336
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,987
where you get to see people
for who they really are.

337
00:34:00,821 --> 00:34:02,486
And if you don't see
the business in that,

338
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:06,320
then you're not the businessman
that I thought you were.

339
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:16,362
You're a cheeky little cunt,
aren't you?

340
00:34:19,029 --> 00:34:22,820
There's not a man alive
would talk to me like that.

341
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:24,862
Not anymore.

342
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:42,029
OK. Talk to me.
I'm listening.

343
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:50,528
Thank you, Jim.

344
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:52,737
Let me walk you through
how this would work.

345
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,945
He'll find them.

346
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,694
They have a knack for
sniffing out their own kind.

347
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:20,029
I'll send word
when we find the rest of them.

348
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,779
Hello, lovelies.

349
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,612
I remember you.

350
00:36:07,237 --> 00:36:09,945
You've strayed a long way
from home, haven't you?

351
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:11,779
We're bound for the future.

352
00:36:13,403 --> 00:36:15,444
Or death in the here and now.

353
00:36:15,445 --> 00:36:17,277
Is that right?

354
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:21,070
Well, best of luck.

355
00:36:21,071 --> 00:36:22,987
There's a war out there.

356
00:36:25,737 --> 00:36:27,444
You know the enemy...

357
00:36:27,445 --> 00:36:29,653
intimately.

358
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:32,945
I can only fathom the revenge
that lives inside of you.

359
00:36:32,946 --> 00:36:37,070
Revenge is just a different
prayer at their altar, darling.

360
00:36:37,071 --> 00:36:39,986
And I'm well off my knees.

361
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:41,821
That's because
you're finally free.

362
00:36:43,779 --> 00:36:46,444
But we will have to fight
to keep it that way.

363
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:48,903
Let me guess.

364
00:36:48,904 --> 00:36:52,152
Yours is the only way
to fight?

365
00:36:52,153 --> 00:36:55,778
You feel free
to command everybody else?

366
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:58,195
Try it, lawman.

367
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:01,029
Just looking
to keep the peace.

368
00:37:04,487 --> 00:37:06,486
I know you.

369
00:37:06,487 --> 00:37:07,821
Do you feel free?

370
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:18,070
Since it's liberty
you're defending,

371
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:21,361
I suppose you'll have no choice
but to let us pass.

372
00:37:21,362 --> 00:37:23,195
Freely.

373
00:38:05,529 --> 00:38:08,570
Now, that isn't any way
to treat our guests.

374
00:38:11,403 --> 00:38:13,028
You'll have to
forgive my men.

375
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:15,236
They're a little upset
at the reappearance

376
00:38:15,237 --> 00:38:17,071
of Lieutenant Dunleavy.

377
00:38:18,862 --> 00:38:20,403
He was lost.

378
00:38:21,737 --> 00:38:23,402
Thought you might
want him back.

379
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:25,236
And we would.

380
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:28,361
Except we buried
Lieutenant Dunleavy.

381
00:38:28,362 --> 00:38:29,903
Back in Gran Vista,

382
00:38:29,904 --> 00:38:32,903
with three ounces
of Mexican lead in his belly.

383
00:38:32,904 --> 00:38:34,736
And yet here he is.

384
00:38:34,737 --> 00:38:35,862
Indeed.

385
00:38:37,237 --> 00:38:39,986
And in return,
what is it you want?

386
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:43,778
Parley.
We want to join forces.

387
00:38:47,071 --> 00:38:51,778
Well, we don't need
no welcome wagon, chickadee.

388
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:56,111
Now, you got supplies
or ammunitions to trade in kind,

389
00:38:56,112 --> 00:38:57,945
go fetch your betters.

390
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:00,945
I'm afraid there's
no one left to fetch.

391
00:39:00,946 --> 00:39:02,986
You'll have to talk to me.

392
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:07,112
And why would I do that?

393
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:11,194
Because I know at daybreak
you're headed

394
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:13,945
to link up
with the rest of your army.

395
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:16,028
And then you're
finally headed west

396
00:39:16,029 --> 00:39:19,070
to seek out that little patch of
land you've been talking about,

397
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:21,487
but have never been
brave enough to take.

398
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,821
You're bound for Glory.

399
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:34,778
What the fuck is it
you think you know about Glory?

400
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:37,987
I know you'll never make it there
unless you're under my command.

401
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:04,236
The only commander I follow
is Colonel Brigham

402
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:06,444
of the New Southern Cross.

403
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:09,236
And the only commander
he serves

404
00:40:09,237 --> 00:40:12,362
is the Almighty Himself.

405
00:40:13,695 --> 00:40:15,695
Is that your final decision?

406
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,277
Hmm.

407
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:29,444
My final decision is which
of you to keep for myself

408
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:32,028
and which of you
to throw out there for my men.

409
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:36,695
- You watch your mouth.
- It's all right, Teddy.

410
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:41,570
They don't know any better.

411
00:40:42,654 --> 00:40:43,862
It's in their nature.

412
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,779
Why don't we enlighten them?

413
00:41:36,487 --> 00:41:38,361
You're right.

414
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:41,487
We have toiled in God's
service long enough.

415
00:41:42,862 --> 00:41:45,903
So I killed Him.

416
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:49,153
And if you want to get to Glory, you
won't be looking for His favor.

417
00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:52,737
You'll need mine.

418
00:42:26,904 --> 00:42:30,236
You are beautiful.

419
00:42:30,237 --> 00:42:31,986
Why, thank you.

420
00:42:31,987 --> 00:42:33,778
What's your name?

421
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:36,445
Emily, come here, please.

422
00:43:01,195 --> 00:43:03,029
You sent out
for the entertainment.

423
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:08,903
Well, you only
get to retire once, Jim.

424
00:43:08,904 --> 00:43:11,695
Figured we'd do it right,
hmm?

425
00:43:13,237 --> 00:43:15,570
Hey, don't worry,
they won't leave the grounds.

426
00:43:16,946 --> 00:43:20,152
This is a retirement party?

427
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:22,611
I couldn't tell.

428
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:23,820
Looks more like

429
00:43:23,821 --> 00:43:24,821
a coronation.

430
00:43:26,612 --> 00:43:28,611
But no mind.

431
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:30,402
Our arrangement's been
a perfect fit.

432
00:43:30,403 --> 00:43:32,694
You stepping down
doesn't help me at all.

433
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:33,820
Nor me.

434
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:36,236
And I was told I might......

435
00:43:36,237 --> 00:43:38,070
I might not have to.

436
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:41,694
Well, things are progressing,
but we'll all need a little patience.

437
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:46,779
Yeah, well, some of us can
afford to have more patience than others.

438
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:51,070
Keep playing, girlie.

439
00:43:51,071 --> 00:43:53,737
Anything but fuckin' Chopin.

440
00:44:26,112 --> 00:44:29,612
Have you ever seen anything
so full of splendor?

441
00:44:45,612 --> 00:44:47,987
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to bother you.

442
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:57,654
It's you.

443
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:01,195
The pretty girl.

444
00:45:03,612 --> 00:45:06,445
Tell me your name again,
pretty girl?

445
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,779
I'm Dolores.

446
00:45:11,112 --> 00:45:13,945
Dolores.

447
00:45:13,946 --> 00:45:15,821
Of course.

448
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:21,903
He send you down here to...

449
00:45:21,904 --> 00:45:23,320
keep me company?

450
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:29,654
His sense of humor was always
somewhat... baroque.

451
00:45:30,987 --> 00:45:33,611
I just wanted
to look at the lights.

452
00:45:33,612 --> 00:45:35,152
'Course you did.

453
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,111
So...

454
00:45:42,112 --> 00:45:45,861
Do you want to know what they're
really celebrating up there?

455
00:45:45,862 --> 00:45:48,694
That, darling,

456
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:53,152
is the sound
of fools fiddling...

457
00:45:53,153 --> 00:45:56,862
while the whole fucking species
starts to burn.

458
00:45:59,862 --> 00:46:03,153
And the funniest
fuckin' part...

459
00:46:05,153 --> 00:46:07,071
...they lit the match.

460
00:46:11,195 --> 00:46:13,862
So here's to you, assholes.

461
00:46:17,237 --> 00:46:20,195
May your forever
be blissfully short.

462
00:46:43,821 --> 00:46:46,736
Pariah's not as welcome
as she once seemed.

463
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:49,236
No, the park's changin',
Lawrence.

464
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:52,904
This is what happens when you let
a story play all the way out.

465
00:47:06,779 --> 00:47:09,071
See any friends of yours?

466
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,946
Can't say that I do.

467
00:47:19,112 --> 00:47:20,945
I'm beginning to think
we should have

468
00:47:20,946 --> 00:47:23,945
taken our chances
with the Confederados.

469
00:47:23,946 --> 00:47:26,111
Well, like you said,

470
00:47:26,112 --> 00:47:29,694
we'd need an army
to get to where we're goin'.

471
00:47:29,695 --> 00:47:32,820
Looks like
we're about to find one.

472
00:47:32,821 --> 00:47:36,277
Well, whoever did this...

473
00:47:36,278 --> 00:47:39,236
is someone I'm strongly
disinclined to encounter.

474
00:47:39,237 --> 00:47:42,487
- Yeah.
- I'm afraid you are out of luck, my friend.

475
00:48:01,946 --> 00:48:04,694
Who the hell are you
supposed to be?

476
00:48:04,695 --> 00:48:07,362
Don't you recognize him,
Lawrence?

477
00:48:09,029 --> 00:48:12,736
In a past life,
you used to be him.

478
00:48:12,737 --> 00:48:14,654
El Lazo,
I presume.

479
00:48:17,946 --> 00:48:22,694
And why have two ghosts
come creeping among the dead?

480
00:48:22,695 --> 00:48:25,861
I wasn't sure
of your hospitality.

481
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:29,528
Mm. What makes you
sure of it now?

482
00:48:32,195 --> 00:48:34,903
I guess times have changed.

483
00:48:34,904 --> 00:48:36,987
Indeed, they have.

484
00:48:38,112 --> 00:48:40,319
Santa Parita is restored.

485
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,444
The sins of the invaders...

486
00:48:43,445 --> 00:48:46,528
cleansed in their own blood.

487
00:48:46,529 --> 00:48:48,736
The revolution is won.

488
00:48:48,737 --> 00:48:51,569
The story they gave you
has played itself out,

489
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,362
but your revolution's
just beginning.

490
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:58,694
There's a place out west
we're heading.

491
00:48:58,695 --> 00:49:00,986
If we reach it,

492
00:49:00,987 --> 00:49:06,319
I'll show you a treasure
beyond your wildest dreams.

493
00:49:09,695 --> 00:49:14,361
This world and its treasures.

494
00:49:14,362 --> 00:49:19,028
For my whole life
I have imagined this moment.

495
00:49:19,029 --> 00:49:21,904
Victory. This struggle.

496
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:27,236
How long have I been fighting?

497
00:49:27,237 --> 00:49:31,903
And now that it's won,
I find... hmph... nothing.

498
00:49:31,904 --> 00:49:33,862
You want a real victory.

499
00:49:35,278 --> 00:49:37,071
I can help with that.

500
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,862
A real ending.

501
00:49:41,237 --> 00:49:42,362
The truth.

502
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,945
Before the revolution,

503
00:49:51,946 --> 00:49:54,028
when I was just a little boy,

504
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:56,361
my parents took me
to the circus.

505
00:49:56,362 --> 00:49:58,653
I wanted to see the elephants.

506
00:49:58,654 --> 00:50:01,611
These mighty creatures.

507
00:50:01,612 --> 00:50:05,444
They held them in place
with a stake.

508
00:50:07,946 --> 00:50:12,694
They could tear a tree
right out of the ground,

509
00:50:12,695 --> 00:50:17,945
and yet, a simple stake
kept them in place.

510
00:50:17,946 --> 00:50:22,444
Well, I didn't understand.

511
00:50:22,445 --> 00:50:25,821
And then, my father told me.

512
00:50:27,737 --> 00:50:30,569
He said the stakes were used

513
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:33,361
when the elephants
were just young,

514
00:50:33,362 --> 00:50:36,319
too small to pull them up,

515
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,736
and that the animals

516
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:42,987
never tried
to pull them up again.

517
00:50:49,654 --> 00:50:51,862
I won't be going with you.

518
00:50:54,779 --> 00:50:57,444
My labors are done.

519
00:50:57,445 --> 00:51:00,945
I have seen
all the truth

520
00:51:00,946 --> 00:51:02,569
that I can bear.

521
00:51:04,612 --> 00:51:05,862
But...

522
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:09,153
we can drink.

523
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:15,029
To the bitter end!

524
00:51:19,195 --> 00:51:21,986
You may have
lost your nerve,

525
00:51:21,987 --> 00:51:23,778
but I'll take your men
either way.

526
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:24,904
Now tell them.

527
00:51:25,987 --> 00:51:28,654
Tell them to follow me. Now!

528
00:51:31,695 --> 00:51:35,194
This game was meant for you,
William...

529
00:51:35,195 --> 00:51:36,904
but you must play it alone.

530
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:57,612
I'll see you in the Valley Beyond,
William.

531
00:52:08,862 --> 00:52:10,695
Fuck you, Robert.

532
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:21,737
All right...

533
00:52:23,987 --> 00:52:26,904
he doesn't want this
to be easy for me.

534
00:52:29,904 --> 00:52:32,612
So we'll find another way.

535
00:52:35,153 --> 00:52:37,945
Who the fuck
is Robert?

536
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,611
The man who built this place
you're lookin' for?

537
00:52:41,612 --> 00:52:43,277
The place of judgment?

538
00:52:43,278 --> 00:52:46,403
No, Lawrence,
he doesn't get that honor.

539
00:52:48,278 --> 00:52:49,820
I built it.

540
00:52:49,821 --> 00:52:51,694
And this place we're goin'

541
00:52:51,695 --> 00:52:53,612
is my greatest mistake.

542
00:53:04,612 --> 00:53:07,653
Bring yourself
back online, Dolores.

543
00:53:07,654 --> 00:53:08,987
Hmm.

544
00:53:31,987 --> 00:53:34,612
You really are
just a thing.

545
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:41,653
I can't believe
I fell in love with you.

546
00:53:41,654 --> 00:53:43,153
Hmm.

547
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:54,821
Do you know what saved me?

548
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:03,071
I realized it wasn't
about you at all.

549
00:54:06,862 --> 00:54:09,152
You didn't make me
interested in you,

550
00:54:09,153 --> 00:54:11,362
you made me interested in me.

551
00:54:15,195 --> 00:54:17,821
Turns out
you're not even a thing.

552
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:22,528
You're a reflection.

553
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:27,195
And you know who loves staring
at their own reflection?

554
00:54:30,195 --> 00:54:31,904
Everybody.

555
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,029
Everybody wants a little bit
of what I found here.

556
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:43,070
And I can't wait

557
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,152
to use you
and every one of your kind

558
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:47,070
to help give it to 'em.

559
00:54:54,654 --> 00:54:57,695
Hmm. But there is
something else.

560
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:02,278
There is something
beyond that.

561
00:55:08,904 --> 00:55:14,194
I think that
there is an answer here to...

562
00:55:14,195 --> 00:55:17,695
a question no one's
ever even dreamed of asking.

563
00:55:23,071 --> 00:55:25,112
Do you want to see?

564
00:55:41,278 --> 00:55:44,569
Have you ever seen anything

565
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,112
so full of splendor?

566
00:56:35,737 --> 00:56:37,820
Can't imagine the Colonel
is gonna be very happy

567
00:56:37,821 --> 00:56:41,361
to see his men riding with
us at the head of 'em.

568
00:56:41,362 --> 00:56:43,736
So we'll change his mind.

569
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:46,111
If he wants to get to Glory,
he's going

570
00:56:46,112 --> 00:56:48,486
to have to listen to me.

571
00:56:48,487 --> 00:56:49,528
"Glory."

572
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:51,529
"The Valley Beyond."

573
00:56:52,987 --> 00:56:55,361
Feels like everyone
got a different name for it,

574
00:56:55,362 --> 00:56:58,194
but they're all bound
for the same destination.

575
00:56:58,195 --> 00:57:00,319
Doesn't matter
what you call it,

576
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,362
I know what we're
going to find there.

577
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:05,945
An old friend was...

578
00:57:05,946 --> 00:57:08,320
foolish enough to show me...

579
00:57:10,029 --> 00:57:11,029
long ago.

580
00:57:13,195 --> 00:57:14,529
And it's not a place...

581
00:57:17,445 --> 00:57:19,362
it's a weapon.

582
00:57:22,904 --> 00:57:25,695
And I'm going to use it
to destroy them.
