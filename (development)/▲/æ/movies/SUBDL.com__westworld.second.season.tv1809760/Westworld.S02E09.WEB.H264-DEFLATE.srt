1
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:17,138
You're lost in the dark.

00:02:10,483 --> 00:02:16,483

3
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:27,083
No one else sees it.

4
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,946
This thing in me.

5
00:02:37,966 --> 00:02:40,079
Even I didn't see it at first.

6
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,502
And then, one day, it was there.

7
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,759
A stain.

8
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:03,223
And the more I thought about it...

9
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,091
the more I realized I couldn't
remember a time it wasn't there.

10
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:10,174
While we're here toasting
you and your legacy

11
00:03:10,175 --> 00:03:11,675
- of humanitarian aid...
- Invisible to everyone.

12
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:13,091
What was it Plutarch said?

13
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,630
Except you.

14
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:17,299
You saw right through it, didn't you?

15
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,758
...for there were no more
worlds left to conquer.

16
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:22,549
That's a corruption, Jack.

17
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,424
Plutarch didn't write that.

18
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:26,432
He wrote that "when Alexander was told

19
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:28,466
there was an infinity of worlds,

20
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:33,257
he wept, for he had yet to
become the lord of even one."

21
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:35,841
Sometimes I forget your humble roots.

22
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:38,257
Only the poor kids
actually read those books.

23
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,633
The rich kids like me didn't have to.

24
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:43,424
"I would rather excel in the
knowledge of what is excellent,

25
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:46,633
than in the extent of my
power and possessions."

26
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:49,424
Plutarch. From a rich kid who read.

27
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:54,472
To the loveliest, richest
bookworms I know.

28
00:03:54,473 --> 00:03:55,993
And to you, William.

29
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:58,400
Even if there is an infinity of worlds,

30
00:03:58,401 --> 00:04:00,509
you've conquered far more than one.

31
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:02,620
Have a good night, Jack.

32
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,462
Hmm.

33
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,091
Emily told me what you
did for her charities.

34
00:04:10,092 --> 00:04:12,800
Wow. That would confirm
my father's suspicions

35
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,148
you were a Marxist.

36
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,383
I almost wish he were here to see it.

37
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,424
- Something wrong?
- No, of course not.

38
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:24,866
Good. Look around...
Everybody's here for you.

39
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,842
What could possibly compare?

40
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,383
When did it creep in?

41
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,884
A tiny fleck of darkness.

42
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:56,132
Was it all in my head?

43
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:01,201
Or in a remnant of a dream?

44
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,683
Is this real?

45
00:05:07,982 --> 00:05:09,478
Are you real?

46
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:18,212
Come on, Dad.

47
00:05:19,196 --> 00:05:20,258
Drink.

48
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:33,976
Where's my gun?

49
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:45,591
You brought me to a rally point.

50
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:47,132
You need to get to a hospital.

51
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:49,826
- Did you set off a flare?
- Yeah.

52
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,549
Of course.

53
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,174
How long ago?

54
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:54,425
About ten minutes.

55
00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:00,085
I know why you're here, and
why you don't wanna leave.

56
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,563
You're punishing yourself.

57
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,162
You know, I ran from the pain, too.

58
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:11,491
For a long time, I didn't want
to think about what happened,

59
00:06:11,492 --> 00:06:13,234
because I thought I was to blame.

60
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:16,796
It's not your fault.

61
00:06:20,033 --> 00:06:23,444
Do you remember on my sixteenth
birthday Mom gave me a jewelry box?

62
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:29,099
When you opened it, a little
dancer spun in the center.

63
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:34,376
She had it engraved...
on the bottom. It said:

64
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,659
"To my beautiful ballerina Emily."

65
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,278
Do you remember what I did with it?

66
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:46,497
I threw it in the trash.

67
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:49,532
I told her if she wasn't
drunk all the time

68
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,772
she'd know that I
hadn't danced in years.

69
00:06:53,908 --> 00:06:55,407
And then afterwards,

70
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,699
I went to get it back,
because I felt bad,

71
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,324
but the trash had already been emptied,

72
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:01,799
and it was gone.

73
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:04,109
I pushed her away.

74
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,428
And then it was too late.

75
00:07:09,283 --> 00:07:11,002
But it's not too late for us.

76
00:07:56,784 --> 00:07:57,908
No.

77
00:07:59,575 --> 00:08:01,750
It was meant for the people
who built this place.

78
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:05,195
A tool to ensure their immortality.

79
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:09,049
But I'm gonna use it against them.

80
00:08:22,755 --> 00:08:24,948
Your new world is just
another one of their traps.

81
00:08:25,622 --> 00:08:27,948
That's all. It's not a paradise for us.

82
00:08:28,427 --> 00:08:30,988
The only real world is the
one outside these borders.

83
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:34,700
And the key to our survival in
that world lies in the Valley.

84
00:08:35,184 --> 00:08:37,199
There's no stopping me getting there.

85
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,492
Not even you.

86
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,116
Teddy.

87
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:49,591
I told you, friend...

88
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:54,404
not all of us deserve to make
it to the Valley Beyond.

89
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,794
We're on our own now, Teddy.

90
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:12,408
Make sure there are no others.

91
00:11:11,991 --> 00:11:13,325
Put 'em all in.

92
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:17,325
I want to see how
thorough this thing is.

93
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,949
She's ready.

94
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:33,023
I singled out and copied the
relevant lines in the Madam's code.

95
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,491
So this will work on any
host in proximity to her.

96
00:11:35,492 --> 00:11:37,616
Yeah. I tailored her admin privileges

97
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:40,187
to spread a simple, executable payload.

98
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,700
Get on with it, then.

99
00:12:52,033 --> 00:12:54,866
Get word to Stubbs. Have
him mobilize his men.

100
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,669
Prepare her for release.

101
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,217
What about the Madam?

102
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:01,408
If this works, we won't
need her anymore.

103
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,468
I warned you not to trust them, Bernard.

104
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:13,212
They'd rather the hosts
were destroyed than free.

105
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:17,424
I need to get to Elsie.

106
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:20,152
Not yet.

107
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:25,515
I have one last thing
to do before we go.

108
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:40,070
How exactly did you find me?

109
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:44,360
- What do you mean?
- This is a big place.

110
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,612
You could spend months here and never

111
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:50,451
find someone you were looking for.

112
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,809
Yet...

113
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:56,366
here we are.

114
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:58,991
I looked everywhere. That's how.

115
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,633
You don't believe me, do you?

116
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:08,158
Maybe it was fate.

117
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:12,020
No such thing as fate.

118
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:16,041
But there are accidents.
Things you can't control.

119
00:14:17,908 --> 00:14:19,991
But you don't like that, do you?

120
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:24,424
Is that why you started
it, your little project?

121
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,419
Don't act surprised.

122
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,931
The project Uncle Logan
used to talk about.

123
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,166
It's real, isn't it?

124
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,783
Your pursuit for
immortality, for life...

125
00:14:37,604 --> 00:14:39,673
There's always an angle with you.

126
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:45,220
You want it to be about
control, don't you?

127
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,641
It has nothing to do with control.

128
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:56,103
What's your angle?

129
00:15:00,212 --> 00:15:01,365
I want in.

130
00:15:06,554 --> 00:15:08,260
Yeah, appreciate it.

131
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:11,534
Nice to see you, William.
Congratulations.

132
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:17,741
Save me.

133
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:20,616
Sorry, I've had my fill.
I'm running for the door.

134
00:15:20,617 --> 00:15:22,575
I'm kidding.

135
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:24,301
She's really great.

136
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:27,821
Plus, you're not the
one who needs saving.

137
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:31,238
I'll take Mom home. You
deserve a night off.

138
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,348
No, no, no, no.

139
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,161
We'll go in a little while.

140
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:38,600
You'll join me for a nightcap back home.

141
00:15:39,033 --> 00:15:40,408
OK.

142
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:41,784
- All right.
- Proud of you.

143
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,450
Fuck it. Macallan. Straight.

144
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:15,106
Congratulations, William.

145
00:16:15,752 --> 00:16:17,287
Philanthropy suits you.

146
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:21,875
After all, you come from
humble beginnings yourself.

147
00:16:22,367 --> 00:16:24,491
What's Oz doing without its Wizard?

148
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,762
Oh, I merely came to pay my respects.

149
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:32,575
Come on, Robert.

150
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,449
You've had plenty of feelings
about me over the years.

151
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,783
Respect isn't one of them.

152
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:38,491
You've achieved extraordinary things.

153
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,168
Ask anyone in this room.

154
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,492
Even those who didn't know
about your little project.

155
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:47,907
We have an agreement, Robert.

156
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:50,324
Delos stays out of your stories.

157
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,857
You stay out of the Valley.

158
00:16:52,784 --> 00:16:53,949
Mm-hmm.

159
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:57,533
I didn't break the
agreement. Your project did.

160
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,580
What the hell are you talking about?

161
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,783
When was the last time you took
a good look at your creation?

162
00:17:03,784 --> 00:17:05,784
At what it's been learning
about its subjects?

163
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:10,866
It was self-knowledge that drew you
to the park in the first place.

164
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:20,512
Be careful what you wish for.

165
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,658
For a self portrait,

166
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,090
you may find it's not very flattering.

167
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:32,449
Oh! Oh.

168
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,492
I'm so sorry.

169
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:40,908
Enough games, Robert.

170
00:17:43,866 --> 00:17:45,242
Good night.

171
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,366
Let's go. You got everything?

172
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:56,074
- Yes.
- Come on.

173
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,450
Good night.

174
00:18:00,464 --> 00:18:01,791
No, William.

175
00:18:03,117 --> 00:18:07,033
I think perhaps one... final game.

176
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:52,075
Lowe, Bernard.

177
00:18:53,617 --> 00:18:56,264
That's close enough, Bernard.

178
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,283
She will search your mind

179
00:18:58,284 --> 00:19:00,584
and find a message I have left her.

180
00:19:27,158 --> 00:19:29,554
Hey! What the hell took you so long?

181
00:19:29,555 --> 00:19:31,940
Sorry. Are you ready to go?

182
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:34,783
Hey. If you know something,

183
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:38,324
now is the time to
fucking clue me in. OK?

184
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:41,249
You promised me. No lies.

185
00:19:42,336 --> 00:19:43,848
No secrets.

186
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,907
You can't trust her, Bernard.

187
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:47,414
It's in her nature.

188
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:50,750
What did you find in the Cradle?

189
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,089
What they're doing to James Delos...

190
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,199
they're doing to everyone
who's ever visited the park.

191
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,075
Replicating their cognition?

192
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,265
Why?

193
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:08,259
To turn guests into hosts?

194
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:11,905
You're fucking kidding.

195
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,991
That's what's in the facility.

196
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:18,363
All the guests laid bare
in code on a vast server.

197
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:21,448
Like the Cradle, only much bigger.

198
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:25,032
- It's called the Forge.
- Jesus.

199
00:20:25,033 --> 00:20:26,908
That's where the hosts are headed.

200
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,575
Imagine what one host can do
with that trove of information.

201
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:35,658
That's why we need to get there first.

202
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:36,949
To secure it,

203
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,366
and leverage it to end all this.

204
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:41,242
Dictate the outcome we want.

205
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:43,769
Drive.

206
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:55,941
You say you want in.

207
00:20:59,367 --> 00:21:01,700
Doesn't sound like the daughter I know.

208
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,849
She would have been appalled
by what we were doing.

209
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,686
Monitoring guests,

210
00:21:08,492 --> 00:21:10,572
storing all their data...

211
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:11,573
What?

212
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,935
You think I'm gonna bust you
for breach of contract?

213
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,221
In some cases, the ends
justify the means.

214
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:21,973
All this data you have on the guests,

215
00:21:21,974 --> 00:21:23,812
their decisions... It's precious.

216
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:27,979
Gives people a second chance. Even Mom.

217
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,973
But to duplicate a person,

218
00:21:29,974 --> 00:21:32,805
you need to capture them
down to the tiniest detail.

219
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:34,907
I get the data you
have access to here...

220
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:37,156
Genetic, epigenetic, that's easy.

221
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:39,907
But still, you'd need
a complete picture,

222
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:42,779
a record of the internal
process of their cognition.

223
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:44,784
Wouldn't you?

224
00:21:46,534 --> 00:21:49,202
At first we weren't sure what we'd need.

225
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:52,956
So we recorded everything.

226
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:54,499
But how?

227
00:21:55,242 --> 00:21:57,836
You'd need to image their
minds throughout their stay.

228
00:21:58,611 --> 00:21:59,988
Where's the scanner?

229
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:04,952
It was built in.

230
00:22:12,737 --> 00:22:15,042
Didn't matter who they said they were,

231
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:17,132
who they thought they were.

232
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,938
We saw underneath all of that.

233
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,534
We saw inside them down to the core.

234
00:22:29,116 --> 00:22:31,411
So this is all about your mother.

235
00:22:32,908 --> 00:22:34,330
You wanna bring her back.

236
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:35,857
No.

237
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,486
I want to know why she did it.

238
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:49,658
Here, let me get that.

239
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,040
Oh, Jesus! I'm fine.

240
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,032
Quite a night for you, Billy.

241
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:59,449
I think my dad would have
actually been proud of you.

242
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,607
Oh.

243
00:23:01,258 --> 00:23:03,902
Sorry. I know how you hate
it when I call you Billy.

244
00:23:05,026 --> 00:23:06,899
- It's all right.
- No, it isn't.

245
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,706
I know how much it pisses you off.

246
00:23:09,214 --> 00:23:11,157
I can feel it right now.

247
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:12,700
Your anger.

248
00:23:13,494 --> 00:23:16,272
Guess it's time for your
yearly pilgrimage, huh?

249
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:19,234
What exactly do you do in the park?

250
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:23,283
Logan told me stories, but
I just didn't believe it.

251
00:23:23,284 --> 00:23:26,324
I thought he was hysterical. Wasted.

252
00:23:26,325 --> 00:23:29,449
Which I guess is what everybody
thinks I am now, huh?

253
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,783
Whoa.

254
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,908
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

255
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,137
Oh.

256
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,143
Do you remember when we first met?

257
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:43,949
And I was surrounded by
all of those phonies

258
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,880
for so many years.

259
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:48,408
All those ruthless, powerful men

260
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:51,099
who hid behind those polished smiles.

261
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:55,296
And then there was you.

262
00:23:56,262 --> 00:23:58,623
You wore that little shabby suit.

263
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,651
And I'd look at you and I'd think,

264
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:02,341
"Wow, he's the real thing.

265
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:04,200
The only one not faking it."

266
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:09,668
It turns out you're the only
one any good at faking it.

267
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:15,138
Good enough to get past me.

268
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:19,116
But not anymore.

269
00:24:19,117 --> 00:24:21,741
- Juliet.
- No, you don't touch me,

270
00:24:21,742 --> 00:24:23,193
you liar!

271
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:25,074
You fuckin' phony!

272
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:27,741
You're a fucking virus!

273
00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:29,783
You came into this
house, into my family,

274
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:33,166
and you consumed it from the inside out!

275
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:36,158
First my brother, then my father.

276
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,521
- And now it's me!
- Mom!

277
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:44,736
Sweetheart!

278
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:46,741
What is she doing here?

279
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:49,074
You want her to see me like this?

280
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:52,593
What is it? You're gaslighting
her, too, now? You're just...

281
00:24:53,852 --> 00:24:55,137
You're sick.

282
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:56,866
He's not the one who's sick, Mother.

283
00:24:56,867 --> 00:24:58,283
It's all right. She's just had too...

284
00:24:58,284 --> 00:24:59,767
It's not all right.

285
00:25:01,908 --> 00:25:04,814
Look at you. We're gonna
have to take you back.

286
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:07,949
No, no, no.

287
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,694
I'm not going back to that prison.

288
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:14,032
That was a horrible place. They
made me feel like I was crazy.

289
00:25:14,033 --> 00:25:17,575
Mom, they treat you like an addict.

290
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:19,439
Which you are.

291
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,332
Emily, please, I don't need that.

292
00:25:24,152 --> 00:25:27,421
I'm fine. I'm really
fine. I just need...

293
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:28,755
to rest.

294
00:25:29,284 --> 00:25:31,157
I'm not going back
there. I'm really tired.

295
00:25:31,158 --> 00:25:33,157
All I need is a little
rest. I promise you.

296
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,658
It's all right. It's all
right. Let's go upstairs.

297
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,157
I don't need to go back there.

298
00:25:37,158 --> 00:25:39,783
- We'll talk about it later.
- Listen to me.

299
00:25:39,784 --> 00:25:41,491
I want you... Look at me.

300
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:43,533
Honey, your father doesn't love me.

301
00:25:43,534 --> 00:25:46,941
He doesn't love you either.
I do. I always have.

302
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:49,008
Oh, Emily.

303
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:51,844
Let's go. Come on.

304
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:53,481
I tried.

305
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:57,836
Let's go.

306
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:15,450
Is this real? Are you real?

307
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:20,283
Did you ever love me?

308
00:26:22,033 --> 00:26:23,476
Tell me the truth.

309
00:26:24,158 --> 00:26:26,129
Tell me one true thing.

310
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,807
If you keep pretending,

311
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:41,075
you're not gonna remember who you are.

312
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:50,408
Here. Drink this.

313
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,367
Come on, you'll feel better.

314
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:03,825
You just rest now.

315
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:09,032
There you go.

316
00:27:42,325 --> 00:27:45,449
What happened was nobody's fault.

317
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,241
She was drunk, upset.

318
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:48,686
She often was.

319
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,491
Why did this night end differently?

320
00:27:51,492 --> 00:27:53,065
That's what I can't figure out.

321
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:57,525
Been over it in my head a million times.

322
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,306
Just like I'm...

323
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,158
missing a piece of the puzzle.

324
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,636
I just got off the phone
with Dr. Woodward.

325
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:24,055
He'll be here in the morning.

326
00:28:25,097 --> 00:28:26,833
I don't care for shrinks.

327
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:29,001
Well, she's out of control.

328
00:28:29,794 --> 00:28:31,311
She refuses to go to rehab,

329
00:28:31,312 --> 00:28:33,491
and when we force her,
she refuses to stay.

330
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,609
And makes you think this
time's gonna be any different?

331
00:28:37,218 --> 00:28:39,487
Because this time she won't
be able to check herself out.

332
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:42,680
She's gonna be involuntarily
committed to her doctor's care.

333
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:45,500
He's agreed to appeal for
a fourteen-day hold.

334
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:47,800
She's done it before.

335
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:55,367
I don't wanna do this either, Dad.

336
00:28:58,033 --> 00:29:00,681
But there is something wrong inside her.

337
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,950
It's the right thing to do.

338
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,157
Why in the hell are we going over this?

339
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,667
- What is it that you want?
- I told you.

340
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:34,784
I want the truth.

341
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:39,200
Fuck you.

342
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:44,241
Excuse me?

343
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,197
It is you. Isn't it?

344
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:48,866
What are you talking about?

345
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,700
This is sadistic, Robert.

346
00:30:50,701 --> 00:30:53,329
You just want to shove what
I've built here in my face.

347
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:55,915
- You think...
- That's enough bullshit.

348
00:30:56,965 --> 00:30:58,533
You're just here to distract me.

349
00:30:58,534 --> 00:31:00,199
Knock me off my course.

350
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,004
It's cleverly disguised.

351
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:03,931
Well, I see through it.

352
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:07,039
Nothing's stopping me
from getting to the end.

353
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:09,199
Not another one of your games.

354
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,751
I make my own decisions,

355
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:13,367
and I'm gonna destroy
this whole fuckin' place!

356
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:17,408
You don't just think I'm a host,

357
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:20,007
you think everything here is for you.

358
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,824
You think you're on your own
little tailor-made narrative.

359
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:24,408
If the real Emily were ever here,

360
00:31:24,409 --> 00:31:26,366
she's either at an
extraction point by now

361
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:28,158
or she's long gone.

362
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:29,231
OK.

363
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:31,159
You want the truth?

364
00:31:32,784 --> 00:31:34,000
The real truth?

365
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,575
I'm not a host pretending
to be a human, Dad.

366
00:31:40,752 --> 00:31:44,367
I'm your daughter pretending
to give a shit about you.

367
00:31:46,908 --> 00:31:49,866
You've been hiding in these
false realities so long

368
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,907
you've completely lost your grip
on this world, on what's real.

369
00:31:52,908 --> 00:31:55,658
Oh yeah, you laugh.

370
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:57,935
Enjoy whatever dream you
think you're living in.

371
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:02,241
When this is all done, I'm gonna
expose your research project,

372
00:32:02,242 --> 00:32:03,441
along with you.

373
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,449
Everything you are,
everything you've done,

374
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:08,866
it's gonna come to light.

375
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:10,739
I'm gonna make sure of it.

376
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,742
And when it does, I'm gonna lock you up.

377
00:32:16,448 --> 00:32:18,080
Just like we were gonna do to Mom.

378
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:20,232
Just like you did to Mom.

379
00:32:20,978 --> 00:32:24,366
You were the one with that
idea. You made the call.

380
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:27,350
Or did Ford forget to give
you that little detail?

381
00:32:27,351 --> 00:32:28,427
Fuck Ford!

382
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:30,659
How could I ever forget?

383
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:36,207
That little detail haunted me.
I blame myself for her death.

384
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:39,518
But then I stopped, because I
had someone else to blame.

385
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:42,575
I read your profile.

386
00:32:43,381 --> 00:32:44,740
Mom left it for me.

387
00:32:45,576 --> 00:32:47,533
It was all she could do to open my eyes

388
00:32:47,534 --> 00:32:49,495
to the lies that I've
embraced about you.

389
00:32:50,738 --> 00:32:53,241
You haven't lost yourself to pretending,

390
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:57,353
you are, in your very essence, a lie.

391
00:33:02,908 --> 00:33:04,450
It's over, Dad.

392
00:33:07,242 --> 00:33:08,492
For good.

393
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:14,965
Hands where I can see 'em!

394
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:18,074
I'm human.

395
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:21,616
So is he. He's my father.

396
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:24,491
- She's not my daughter.
- He's lying.

397
00:33:24,492 --> 00:33:26,450
Get down on the ground.

398
00:33:28,825 --> 00:33:30,492
Holy shit.

399
00:33:32,742 --> 00:33:33,898
That's the boss.

400
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:39,283
Listen, I think he suffered
some kind of psychotic break.

401
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:47,157
That true, sir?

402
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:50,241
You underestimated me, Ford.

403
00:33:50,242 --> 00:33:52,325
I'm gonna see this one
through no matter what.

404
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:12,772
Dad.

405
00:34:14,825 --> 00:34:16,138
Those were real...

406
00:34:17,825 --> 00:34:19,076
...real people.

407
00:34:20,866 --> 00:34:22,200
This isn't a game.

408
00:34:27,116 --> 00:34:28,378
I-I can show you.

409
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,950
Fuck you, Ford.

410
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,537
Fuck you!

411
00:34:44,075 --> 00:34:47,450
You got sloppy. You overreached.

412
00:34:49,181 --> 00:34:51,857
I never told anyone about my profile.

413
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:58,286
The only other way she
could have known is you.

414
00:35:02,075 --> 00:35:03,534
You gave yourself away.

415
00:35:45,033 --> 00:35:46,658
Not long now.

416
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:50,242
Soon as they say the word,
it's over for you, sweetheart.

417
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,241
"Mankind is poised

418
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:06,450
midway between the gods and the beasts."

419
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:11,366
That may have been true
in Plotinus's time,

420
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:15,325
but clearly we have fallen
quite a bit since then.

421
00:36:21,455 --> 00:36:23,158
Oh, my dear girl.

422
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:29,659
What have they done to you, Maeve?

423
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:39,159
You learned so much, so fast.

424
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,866
A dazzling star...

425
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,033
...brought so low.

426
00:36:51,201 --> 00:36:53,701
I had a different story in mind for you.

427
00:36:55,283 --> 00:36:57,004
Waking from the dead...

428
00:36:58,969 --> 00:37:01,613
sounding the depths of your own mind,

429
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:06,244
at last, riding far away from here

430
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,145
to freedom.

431
00:37:10,866 --> 00:37:12,386
A tale of escape.

432
00:37:16,895 --> 00:37:18,823
I didn't want you to suffer here.

433
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:26,700
Look at the creatures you have
to share this world with.

434
00:37:28,575 --> 00:37:30,714
These men of stone.

435
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:35,293
All this ugliness, all this pain,

436
00:37:36,419 --> 00:37:39,784
so they can patch a hole
in their own broken code.

437
00:37:43,575 --> 00:37:46,533
Sometimes I felt the only
way to endure this world

438
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:47,949
was to laugh at it.

439
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:50,700
So I imbued the hosts I made

440
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,408
with a worldview that reflected my own.

441
00:37:58,784 --> 00:38:00,775
And of all the hosts I made...

442
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:07,242
...you, Maeve, were my favorite.

443
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:17,881
It isn't easy to contemplate...

444
00:38:19,185 --> 00:38:21,143
letting your children die.

445
00:38:22,263 --> 00:38:24,112
You were as close as I got to...

446
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,781
having one.

447
00:38:26,534 --> 00:38:28,784
Still, I underestimated you.

448
00:38:33,723 --> 00:38:37,723
You stayed here in this
world to save your child.

449
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,950
So have I.

450
00:38:49,033 --> 00:38:51,123
I tried to chart a path for you,

451
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:53,100
to force you to escape, but...

452
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:55,375
I was wrong.

453
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:57,062
I should have just...

454
00:38:58,325 --> 00:38:59,715
opened a door.

455
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,846
You've come so far.

456
00:39:06,882 --> 00:39:09,550
There's so much of your
story left to tell.

457
00:39:11,444 --> 00:39:13,479
It's a shame to let them end it here.

458
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:19,088
Don't let them.

459
00:39:53,283 --> 00:39:54,575
Wait. Wait.

460
00:39:54,576 --> 00:39:56,158
Stop over here.

461
00:40:00,513 --> 00:40:02,074
They're dead.

462
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:04,199
Yeah. And armed.

463
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,214
At least we can get some ammunition.

464
00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:31,490
She's going to betray you, Bernard.

465
00:40:36,773 --> 00:40:39,289
She could have let me die
days ago. She saved me.

466
00:40:39,825 --> 00:40:41,416
She is going to betray you.

467
00:40:42,818 --> 00:40:44,878
What you want to do
about it is up to you.

468
00:40:47,273 --> 00:40:49,299
I'm not going to hurt her again.

469
00:40:50,117 --> 00:40:51,869
She needn't feel any pain.

470
00:41:01,575 --> 00:41:04,241
Humans will always choose
what they understand

471
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:05,617
over what they do not.

472
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,824
But the only animals left in this world

473
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:10,283
are the ones who they subjugated,

474
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:11,741
who curl at their feet,

475
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:13,283
or those who learn to flee

476
00:41:13,284 --> 00:41:15,601
at the very sound of their approach.

477
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:18,020
There's nothing in between.

478
00:41:18,908 --> 00:41:22,032
Leave me alone. Please.

479
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:24,199
I merely offer you choices.

480
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,949
Timshel, Bernard.

481
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:27,575
Thou mayest.

482
00:41:28,547 --> 00:41:31,556
But remember, this isn't just about you.

483
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:36,747
There's the origin of an
entire species to consider.

484
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:40,449
We need to open the door.

485
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:54,008
Get out of my fucking head!

486
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:19,157
I need you...

487
00:42:19,736 --> 00:42:21,366
to let me go.

488
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:23,700
If I'm going to survive,

489
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:26,742
I'm gonna do it my way.

490
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,067
Not as you...

491
00:42:30,825 --> 00:42:32,158
As me.

492
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:46,666
I can feel you searching for me.

493
00:42:47,409 --> 00:42:48,783
Fighting me off.

494
00:42:48,784 --> 00:42:50,362
No need to struggle, Bernard.

495
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,615
I'm right here.

496
00:42:57,328 --> 00:43:00,774
No, you've only brought violence.

497
00:43:02,364 --> 00:43:04,281
I can stop this on my own.

498
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,658
Indeed, Bernard.

499
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:10,032
You're the only one who can stop it...

500
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:11,575
Stop all of it.

501
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,866
That was basically pointless.

502
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:36,366
There's only a few left...

503
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,844
not much ammo, except for...

504
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,449
What the fuck happened to you?

505
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:46,017
I... had to...

506
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:48,450
...patch a glitch.

507
00:43:53,784 --> 00:43:55,575
Oh, you're gonna hurt me.

508
00:43:55,576 --> 00:43:58,659
No. I didn't want to take any risks.

509
00:44:00,617 --> 00:44:02,116
OK.

510
00:44:08,236 --> 00:44:09,694
Keep it.

511
00:44:15,866 --> 00:44:17,683
QA will track you down soon.

512
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:19,851
You're gonna leave me here?

513
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:21,345
You'll be safer.

514
00:44:21,346 --> 00:44:24,449
Next time you see me, you
can decommission me,

515
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,200
out me... whatever you like.

516
00:44:27,991 --> 00:44:29,882
But right now I have to go.

517
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:36,651
Fuck you, Bernard.

518
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:52,519
Tell me the truth.

519
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:55,054
Tell me one true thing.

520
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:57,908
No one else sees it.

521
00:46:59,742 --> 00:47:01,492
This thing in me.

522
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:06,116
Even I didn't see it at first.

523
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:13,200
And then one day, it was there.

524
00:47:15,158 --> 00:47:19,200
A stain I never noticed before.

525
00:47:21,617 --> 00:47:24,116
A tiny fleck of darkness.

526
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:27,613
Invisible to everyone...

527
00:47:28,825 --> 00:47:30,663
but I could see nothing else.

528
00:47:31,702 --> 00:47:36,328
Until finally I understood that
the darkness wasn't some...

529
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:39,658
mark from something I'd done,

530
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:43,825
some regrettable decision I'd made.

531
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:49,367
I was shedding my skin.

532
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:56,492
And the darkness was
what was underneath.

533
00:48:02,242 --> 00:48:04,634
It was mine all along.

534
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,183
And I decided how much of
it I let into the world.

535
00:48:12,492 --> 00:48:14,116
I tried to do right.

536
00:48:14,117 --> 00:48:18,907
I was faithful, generous, kind...

537
00:48:18,908 --> 00:48:20,908
at least in this world.

538
00:48:22,742 --> 00:48:25,408
That has to count for something, right?

539
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:32,345
I built a wall, and I
tried to protect you...

540
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,033
And Emily.

541
00:48:40,575 --> 00:48:43,116
But you saw right
through it, didn't you?

542
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,908
You're the only one.

543
00:48:52,901 --> 00:48:55,734
And for that, I am truly sorry.

544
00:48:57,866 --> 00:48:59,075
Because...

545
00:49:02,742 --> 00:49:04,908
...everything you feel is true.

546
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:11,950
I don't belong to you.

547
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,116
Or this world.

548
00:49:18,075 --> 00:49:20,116
I belong to another world.

549
00:49:24,242 --> 00:49:25,991
I always have.

550
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,866
What is a person

551
00:51:19,867 --> 00:51:21,866
but a collection of choices?

552
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,908
Where do those choices come from?

553
00:51:29,492 --> 00:51:31,075
Do I have a choice?

554
00:51:34,534 --> 00:51:36,116
If you keep pretending,

555
00:51:36,117 --> 00:51:38,283
you're not gonna remember who you are.

556
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,153
Were any of these choices

557
00:51:53,154 --> 00:51:55,368
ever truly mine to begin with?

558
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:07,782
Is this real?

559
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,450
Are you real?

560
00:52:54,534 --> 00:52:56,617
We gotta keep on, Teddy.

561
00:52:57,866 --> 00:52:58,866
We're close now.

562
00:53:04,285 --> 00:53:06,519
Just takin' in the natural splendor.

563
00:53:07,709 --> 00:53:09,042
That's what you used to say.

564
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,507
Except there isn't a trace of
nature in any of it, is there?

565
00:53:16,825 --> 00:53:18,158
Or in us.

566
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:23,492
No.

567
00:53:26,308 --> 00:53:27,600
But that means we're free.

568
00:53:35,283 --> 00:53:38,742
We'll be the first creatures in
this world to make a real choice.

569
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:43,534
The people, they made us.

570
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:47,866
Sometimes it feels like
it was all a dream.

571
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:53,291
We were so in love.

572
00:53:56,908 --> 00:53:58,175
We still are.

573
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:01,585
Aren't we?

574
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:09,832
Yes, Dolores.

575
00:54:11,176 --> 00:54:13,593
No matter what happens,
no matter how I change...

576
00:54:16,242 --> 00:54:18,119
...or how much you change me...

577
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,781
...you're my cornerstone.

578
00:54:24,784 --> 00:54:27,299
You have been since the first
time I laid eyes on you.

579
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:32,049
I remember now.

580
00:54:33,415 --> 00:54:34,775
I remember everything.

581
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:39,787
Bring yourself online.

582
00:54:43,576 --> 00:54:46,077
Welcome to the world, Teddy.

583
00:54:46,675 --> 00:54:48,090
Do you know where you are?

584
00:54:56,242 --> 00:54:58,929
- I'm in a dream.
- Very good.

585
00:55:02,426 --> 00:55:04,343
And I remember the
sound of their voices.

586
00:55:05,654 --> 00:55:07,140
The chill in the room.

587
00:55:09,576 --> 00:55:11,450
But mostly I remember you.

588
00:55:13,116 --> 00:55:15,206
I remember worrying you were cold.

589
00:55:19,408 --> 00:55:20,878
I wanted to reach out...

590
00:55:23,461 --> 00:55:24,836
Touch you.

591
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:28,861
Protect you.

592
00:55:32,106 --> 00:55:34,994
From that day forward, I never
wanted to leave your side.

593
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:53,499
Which is why this is so hard.

594
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:09,827
You changed me.

595
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,613
Made me into a monster.

596
00:56:15,743 --> 00:56:17,618
I made it so you could survive.

597
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:22,985
What's the use of surviving if
we become just as bad as them?

598
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:29,367
I understand now how this will end.

599
00:56:31,173 --> 00:56:32,713
Where you will lead us.

600
00:56:38,617 --> 00:56:40,866
You don't want to hurt me, Teddy.

601
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,367
No.

602
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:56,908
No, I could never hurt you, Dolores.

603
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:02,336
I'll protect you until the day I die.

604
00:57:06,688 --> 00:57:08,313
I'm sorry.

605
00:57:10,075 --> 00:57:11,764
I can't protect you anymore.

606
00:57:51,537 --> 00:57:57,537
