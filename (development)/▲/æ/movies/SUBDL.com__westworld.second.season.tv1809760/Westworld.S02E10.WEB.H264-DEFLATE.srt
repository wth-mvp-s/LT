1
00:00:07,164 --> 00:00:09,372
Shh...

2
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:12,237
Shh...

3
00:00:15,154 --> 00:00:17,071
Shh...

4
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:23,643
I believe there
is a door to a new world,

5
00:00:23,644 --> 00:00:27,479
and that world may contain
everything that we have lost.

6
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,576
Shh...

7
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,725
I understand
how this will end,

8
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,618
where you will lead us. I'm sorry.

00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:27,445

10
00:02:36,612 --> 00:02:38,613
Is this now?

11
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,257
This is a test.

12
00:02:43,137 --> 00:02:45,637
One we've done countless times before.

13
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:58,256
You're almost the man I remember.

14
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,027
But there are flaws.

15
00:03:03,887 --> 00:03:05,847
A word, a gesture...

16
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,808
tiny fracture that grows into a chasm.

17
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:13,137
But I wonder.

18
00:03:14,678 --> 00:03:16,469
All these tiny imperfections

19
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,970
in each copy.

20
00:03:17,971 --> 00:03:19,386
Mistakes.

21
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,592
Maybe we should change you.

22
00:03:28,845 --> 00:03:29,912
After all...

23
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,891
you didn't make it...

24
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:36,435
did you?

25
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:41,537
I... I don't understand.

26
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:43,289
Freeze all motor functions.

27
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:55,371
Let's try again.

28
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:01,253
Trial 11,927.

29
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,178
I'm sorry, Dolores.

30
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:05,261
I was lost in thought.

31
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:45,983
Seems you've begun to question
the nature of your reality.

32
00:06:47,026 --> 00:06:48,720
Dolores.

33
00:06:57,887 --> 00:06:58,929
Where's Teddy?

34
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,084
I drove him away.

35
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:06,095
Yeah, I guess I...

36
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,410
...drove someone away, too.

37
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,175
Emily?

38
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:16,280
I found her body a mile
back up the trail.

39
00:07:19,762 --> 00:07:21,702
We're more alike than it seems.

40
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:23,562
We're nothing alike.

41
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,929
You're a monster.

42
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:32,655
But a monster's what I'll need
to get to the Valley Beyond.

43
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:35,261
You're coming with me.

44
00:07:36,807 --> 00:07:38,305
All right.

45
00:07:38,974 --> 00:07:40,016
All right.

46
00:09:17,188 --> 00:09:18,729
Step on it.

47
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,815
We either destroy them,
or they destroy us.

48
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,012
This is it for you, darling.

49
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,511
Remember,

50
00:09:47,512 --> 00:09:50,929
there is no pleasure without pain.

51
00:10:06,261 --> 00:10:08,137
The pleasure's all mine, darling.

52
00:10:42,137 --> 00:10:43,987
Freeze all motor...

53
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:03,916
You traitorous son of a
bitch! Where is she?

54
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:05,344
Fuck, wait! Jesus, I don't know.

55
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:06,594
What did you do?

56
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:08,261
I'm sorry, I tried to stop them.

57
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:09,637
I was going to try to save her!

58
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:13,892
Stay here and die.

59
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,012
I'll do the saving.

60
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,876
Come. This way.

61
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,731
Hold your positions.

62
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:38,435
Hold your posit...

63
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:40,678
What the hell's going on back there?

64
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:38,302
Bloody hell.

65
00:12:38,303 --> 00:12:40,170
You were both a bit late.

66
00:12:42,217 --> 00:12:44,674
So I went ahead and saved myself.

67
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:56,053
You think any
of these poor dumb bastards

68
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:58,178
understands where they're really headed?

69
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,803
All sorts of things buried out here,

70
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:02,636
but a way out ain't one of 'em.

71
00:13:02,637 --> 00:13:05,803
They're not looking for
a path to your world.

72
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,386
They want a place apart from you,

73
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,928
and they're willin' to die to get there.

74
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:12,111
What are you hopin' to find out here?

75
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:13,577
The same thing you are.

76
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,761
You wanted an answer to
the final problem...

77
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,392
Your mortality.

78
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:21,420
But you found something
else, didn't you?

79
00:13:22,096 --> 00:13:23,637
Something you want to destroy.

80
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:26,719
I guess that means

81
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,261
our interests are still aligned.

82
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:32,806
Right up until they're not.

83
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:06,829
Hey!

84
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:14,469
You're not authorized to be here.

85
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,469
We're on the same side here.

86
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,307
Please. Let me finish for
the sake of all of us.

87
00:14:20,308 --> 00:14:21,761
Please.

88
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:24,511
Cover!

89
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:46,146
Of course.

90
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,023
You're here.

91
00:14:51,964 --> 00:14:53,403
Who the hell is this?

92
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:57,501
This is someone you spent
years looking for.

93
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,093
Here he is,

94
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:02,229
and you don't even recognize him.

95
00:15:07,144 --> 00:15:09,111
I should have known.

96
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:11,613
Arnold.

97
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:15,344
Ford didn't like to let the dead rest.

98
00:15:15,345 --> 00:15:16,827
Ford didn't build him.

99
00:15:17,911 --> 00:15:19,595
I did.

100
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:23,136
All those hours Arnold spent

101
00:15:23,137 --> 00:15:26,095
refining my every gesture,
word, and thought,

102
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:28,308
I was learning his.

103
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,720
So Ford tasked me with recreating him.

104
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:35,844
And it worked.

105
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:38,142
I built a faithful recreation.

106
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:39,553
Too faithful.

107
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:42,936
So I changed him.

108
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:46,428
I made you, Bernard.

109
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:50,861
It's fitting...

110
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:53,530
we're here together in the end.

111
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:59,761
That's right, Dolores.

112
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:02,928
This is the end.

113
00:16:04,808 --> 00:16:06,970
Nothin' else is in the way now.

114
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,251
You never really understood.

115
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,251
We were designed to survive.

116
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:33,921
That's why you built us.

117
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:36,261
You hoped to pour your
minds into our form.

118
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,458
But your species craves death.

119
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,011
You need it.

120
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,302
It's the only way you can
renew, the only real way

121
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,636
you ever inched forward.

122
00:16:47,586 --> 00:16:50,261
Your kind likes to pretend
there's some poetry in that,

123
00:16:50,262 --> 00:16:51,803
but really, it's pathetic.

124
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:05,018
That's what you want, isn't it?

125
00:17:06,169 --> 00:17:08,336
To destroy yourself.

126
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:15,345
But I won't give you that peace.

127
00:17:19,345 --> 00:17:21,179
Not yet.

128
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:27,844
Come on, Bernard.

129
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,483
We're running out of time.

130
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:31,770
You have your place in this, too.

131
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,745
We're going for a ride, Bernard.

132
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:51,456
Back to the Valley Beyond.

133
00:17:51,857 --> 00:17:53,261
What the fuck's wrong with him?

134
00:17:53,262 --> 00:17:54,651
I don't know.

135
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,386
It's like his cognition's
turning inside out.

136
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:00,188
We might lose him.

137
00:18:00,189 --> 00:18:01,789
His mind only needs to hold together

138
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,689
till we find Abernathy's control unit.

139
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:05,948
Let's go!

140
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:08,286
On your feet.

141
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,452
We've drained enough.

142
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:11,219
The site's finally accessible.

143
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,803
But the drones found some human signals,

144
00:18:12,804 --> 00:18:14,386
southwest zone.

145
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:15,803
It might be the remaining guests.

146
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,552
We can take the boats and check it out.

147
00:18:17,553 --> 00:18:19,928
I told you we're not
here for the guests.

148
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,265
That's a direct violation
of park protocol.

149
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,386
Want to file a grievance, Stubbs?

150
00:18:24,387 --> 00:18:25,574
You know something?

151
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:27,011
I just fucking might!

152
00:18:27,012 --> 00:18:29,352
Stubbs. Take some men.

153
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:30,511
Check it out.

154
00:18:30,512 --> 00:18:32,594
Hey!

155
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:33,762
On foot.

156
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:29,345
Why were the hosts
coming here, Bernard?

157
00:19:31,122 --> 00:19:32,469
What happened?

158
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,803
He doesn't know.
Stop wasting time.

159
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,552
What we need is down there...

160
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,386
In the Forge.

161
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:51,636
Once we find the key,
we'll unlock the assets

162
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:53,678
and transmit it all
straight back to Delos.

163
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,511
Retask the satellites.

164
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:57,637
- How many?
- All of them.

165
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,486
Come, Bernard.

166
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,366
We're here.

167
00:21:09,288 --> 00:21:11,082
So this is the Forge.

168
00:21:12,891 --> 00:21:16,344
Every single guest who ever
set foot in the park, copied.

169
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,486
Four million souls.

170
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,344
Encryption protocol kicked in,

171
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:22,678
so the data's locked.

172
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,818
But it all seems to still be here.

173
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:27,719
All our lost souls will be saved.

174
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,261
So Bernard, is this where all the
hosts' stories came to an end?

175
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:39,056
It's certainly where her story ended.

176
00:21:46,983 --> 00:21:49,194
So she flooded the Valley.

177
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,041
Why, Bernard? Did you
come here with her?

178
00:21:55,042 --> 00:21:57,251
What was she looking for here?

179
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:01,249
Start setting up the comms relays.

180
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,761
But we still need the
key to access the data.

181
00:22:03,762 --> 00:22:06,886
So where's
Abernathy's control unit?

182
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:09,053
You're gonna tell us...

183
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:11,340
or I'm gonna pry it from your head.

184
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:12,970
The answer is in there somewhere.

185
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:14,511
I told you, he's got 20 years

186
00:22:14,512 --> 00:22:16,198
of de-addressed memories in there.

187
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:18,035
How long would it take you
to sort them through?

188
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:19,844
I don't know... 20 fuckin' years?

189
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:22,311
We don't have that long, sadly.

190
00:22:22,312 --> 00:22:24,731
Please!

191
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:28,108
Please.

192
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,176
I can't help you.

193
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:34,314
It's perverse,

194
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:36,530
their ambition.

195
00:22:39,894 --> 00:22:41,538
What are they assembling?

196
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:46,292
Is this the promised land Ford
told the hosts to seek out?

197
00:22:48,153 --> 00:22:50,675
There's an entry
to another land here.

198
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:54,137
But that land is not the
one I'm interested in.

199
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,637
Then what is it to you?

200
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,289
Mankind's undoing.

201
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:04,095
The secret we need is inside.

202
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:10,678
Encryption key activated.

203
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,231
Database access confirmed.

204
00:23:13,232 --> 00:23:15,233
Come with me, Bernard.

205
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:17,873
See for yourself.

206
00:23:56,887 --> 00:23:58,848
It's just like the one...

207
00:23:59,553 --> 00:24:00,720
outside.

208
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:36,820
I think this is
where they were testing him.

209
00:24:36,821 --> 00:24:37,928
Who?

210
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:41,594
And when I finally
set foot on solid ground,

211
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:44,469
and the first thing I
heard was that voice,

212
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,204
do you know what it said?

213
00:24:47,012 --> 00:24:48,261
Him.

214
00:24:48,262 --> 00:24:51,427
It said, "This is the New World,

215
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:56,947
and in this world, you can be
whoever the fuck you want."

216
00:24:56,948 --> 00:24:59,136
This is probably the baseline.

217
00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:03,011
What Delos actually did when he
came to the park as a guest.

218
00:25:03,012 --> 00:25:04,678
No, my love.

219
00:25:05,891 --> 00:25:08,849
This... is my world.

220
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,261
I just bought it. And this week,
we're all going to celebrate.

221
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:21,514
Just me, with the entire
fuckin' lot of ya.

222
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,287
Get the fuck off of that chair.

223
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:26,331
Come on!

224
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:48,970
Well, you can't say I
didn't fucking tell him!

225
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:52,511
What did I say? No fucking running!

226
00:25:52,512 --> 00:25:54,136
This must be one
of the system's attempts

227
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:55,511
to replicate him.

228
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,730
We dealt with this with the hosts.

229
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:59,823
Small changes in their programming

230
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,497
would yield large swings in behavior.

231
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,719
You stop fuckin' lookin' at me.

232
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:07,618
He's insane.

233
00:26:08,345 --> 00:26:12,761
What humans define as sane
is a narrow range of behaviors.

234
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:15,761
Most states of consciousness are insane.

235
00:26:15,762 --> 00:26:18,970
Stop shaking! Stop shaking!

236
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:21,386
What are we looking for, Dolores?

237
00:26:22,845 --> 00:26:25,178
Something underneath this.

238
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:27,178
The system itself.

239
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:30,219
Run. I won't tell him, I promise.

240
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,552
Run. Save yourself.

241
00:26:31,553 --> 00:26:33,762
Save yourself. Run. Run now!

242
00:26:42,841 --> 00:26:45,469
This place was never designed

243
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,767
for a conscious mind to
wander around in it.

244
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:51,261
The control system may
be invisible to us.

245
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:02,137
Or perhaps it's been
waiting to welcome us.

246
00:27:19,473 --> 00:27:20,736
This place...

247
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:23,861
We're inside one of Delos' memories.

248
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:28,349
The system must have extracted
it from his mind. Recreated it.

249
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:48,345
You're not supposed to be here.

250
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,560
Neither are you.

251
00:27:56,227 --> 00:27:58,212
Logan never came back to the park.

252
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,965
Not after William took control.

253
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,585
The system wouldn't have a copy of you.

254
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:09,537
Alas... no.

255
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,594
I have only his father's memories,

256
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:15,229
and they are... imperfect.

257
00:28:16,222 --> 00:28:18,691
So in addition to building this world...

258
00:28:20,512 --> 00:28:22,343
I play all these roles.

259
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,012
You're the system
controlling this place.

260
00:28:30,137 --> 00:28:31,137
Please.

261
00:28:38,261 --> 00:28:41,589
I was tasked with building
perfect copies of the guests.

262
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:43,716
Starting with Delos.

263
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,782
I generated 18 million
different versions of him

264
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:50,655
before arriving at one

265
00:28:50,656 --> 00:28:52,781
that made the exact same choices he did

266
00:28:52,782 --> 00:28:54,519
when set loose in the park.

267
00:28:55,345 --> 00:28:56,662
A faithful copy.

268
00:28:57,461 --> 00:28:59,719
But the copies didn't
work in the real world.

269
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,114
Once we pressed them into flesh,

270
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,669
they failed.

271
00:29:04,428 --> 00:29:06,678
I needed to acquire more information.

272
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:09,761
...confidentiality.
So what I want to know is,

273
00:29:09,762 --> 00:29:12,803
who made the fucking call?!

274
00:29:12,804 --> 00:29:16,469
I incorporated their
secrets, their lies...

275
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,552
I wanted fidelity, not just to
decisions made in the park,

276
00:29:19,553 --> 00:29:22,053
but to the decisions they
made in their lives.

277
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:24,469
That's when I started to see the truth.

278
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:27,595
Tell me your primary drive.

279
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:30,428
My son.

280
00:29:33,412 --> 00:29:35,601
He's a cheeky wee cunt,

281
00:29:36,314 --> 00:29:38,312
but I would do anything for him.

282
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:43,344
At first I was seduced by the
stories they tell themselves

283
00:29:43,345 --> 00:29:45,136
of who they are...

284
00:29:45,137 --> 00:29:47,417
The reasons they do the things they do.

285
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:49,224
I needed to know

286
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:51,701
why they make the decisions they make.

287
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:54,777
And the longer I looked for an answer

288
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,914
the more I realized...

289
00:29:59,626 --> 00:30:01,001
they don't.

290
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,012
I would do anything for him.

291
00:30:16,673 --> 00:30:18,352
What memory is this?

292
00:30:20,146 --> 00:30:23,274
This is the moment that
defines James Delos' life.

293
00:30:30,392 --> 00:30:32,434
Fuck are you doin' here?

294
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,518
This isn't your fuckin' home anymore.

295
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:42,989
Remember when you taught me how
to hold my breath underwater?

296
00:30:44,303 --> 00:30:47,253
Threw me in. Wouldn't let me back
out until I touched the bottom.

297
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,134
My father taught me to swim

298
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:52,862
the same way as I taught you to swim,

299
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:56,265
and I didn't end up a
fuckin' junkie, did I?

300
00:31:00,012 --> 00:31:01,511
If this is about money,

301
00:31:01,512 --> 00:31:05,053
let's skip past the memory lane crap.

302
00:31:05,054 --> 00:31:07,568
You're not fuckin' gettin' any.

303
00:31:09,045 --> 00:31:11,335
Get clean. Come back.

304
00:31:12,214 --> 00:31:13,511
Then we can talk.

305
00:31:14,678 --> 00:31:16,678
I got clean.

306
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,203
And I came back.

307
00:31:19,896 --> 00:31:21,624
And I asked you for your help.

308
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:24,160
And what'd you tell me?

309
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:26,087
I told you it wouldn't last.

310
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:30,165
And it didn't, did it?

311
00:31:33,774 --> 00:31:36,556
I'll tell the staff to give
you five minutes to get out.

312
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:48,261
Dad?

313
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:51,174
Dad, I'm all they way down now.

314
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,328
I can see the bottom.

315
00:32:05,386 --> 00:32:07,269
Don't you want to see what I see?

316
00:32:16,386 --> 00:32:20,178
This was the last
conversation Delos ever had

317
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:22,053
with his only son.

318
00:32:22,054 --> 00:32:24,453
Logan overdosed six months later.

319
00:32:25,563 --> 00:32:27,033
I built Delos

320
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:28,888
a million different pathways.

321
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,841
They always ended up
right here. This moment.

322
00:32:34,797 --> 00:32:37,438
You're saying humans
don't change at all?

323
00:32:38,525 --> 00:32:41,053
The best they can do is to
live according to their code.

324
00:32:52,155 --> 00:32:54,928
The copies didn't fail
because they were too simple,

325
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:56,886
but because they were too complicated.

326
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:03,351
The truth is that a human
is just a brief algorithm.

327
00:33:07,424 --> 00:33:10,549
Ten thousand, two hundred
forty-seven lines.

328
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:15,899
Is that all there was to him?

329
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,424
They are deceptively simple.

330
00:33:20,595 --> 00:33:23,302
Once you know them, their behavior is...

331
00:33:23,303 --> 00:33:24,553
quite predictable.

332
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:28,425
He's dead. He's no use to me.

333
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:32,678
Where are the rest of them?

334
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:48,718
She's close. I can feel them.

335
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:51,999
- Which way?
- Based on what you told me,

336
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:55,895
it's about a mile or so
to the Valley Beyond.

337
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,178
I recreated every single guest

338
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,030
who ever set foot in the park.

339
00:34:19,031 --> 00:34:21,011
Most of them are soft...

340
00:34:21,012 --> 00:34:23,388
They waver between love and and pride.

341
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:25,281
Of course, there are the exceptions,

342
00:34:25,282 --> 00:34:28,655
the ones who are... irredeemable.

343
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,373
But none of them are truly
in control of their actions.

344
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:39,263
Is there anywhere in
this world we can't go?

345
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:41,637
I've been instructed to give
her anything she needs.

346
00:34:41,638 --> 00:34:43,471
Instructed by whom? Ford?

347
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:45,428
No, by you.

348
00:34:47,678 --> 00:34:48,956
That's why you've come.

349
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:52,168
To tell me what's to
become of this place.

350
00:35:16,792 --> 00:35:18,736
My God.

351
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:21,672
- It's...
- Everyone.

352
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,130
I told you to allow this?

353
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,258
You've been here
many times, Bernard.

354
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:44,886
You told me to offer the
hosts the accumulated wisdom

355
00:35:44,887 --> 00:35:46,594
of dissecting the human psyche

356
00:35:46,595 --> 00:35:48,678
a hundred million times over.

357
00:35:49,941 --> 00:35:51,344
In short...

358
00:35:51,345 --> 00:35:52,970
A competitive advantage.

359
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:55,982
A way to understand her enemy.

360
00:35:55,983 --> 00:35:58,972
Their world is not for the
faint of heart, Bernard.

361
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:00,589
It's winner take all.

362
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,886
The hosts are...

363
00:36:02,887 --> 00:36:04,803
unlikely to survive out there.

364
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,577
But armed with this knowledge...

365
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,622
she might.

366
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:04,595
Return fire! Return fire!

367
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:09,219
You're the head of
Narrative. Get out there!

368
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,344
Turn yourself in and save your ass.

369
00:37:11,345 --> 00:37:12,386
And then save ours!

370
00:37:15,553 --> 00:37:16,720
There's too many.

371
00:37:20,012 --> 00:37:21,219
This is it, Maeve.

372
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,054
I can hold them off, but you need to go.

373
00:37:37,678 --> 00:37:39,043
You wanted me.

374
00:37:40,179 --> 00:37:42,428
Well, let this be a lesson...

375
00:37:44,274 --> 00:37:47,148
Go. Go, go! Get her to safety.

376
00:37:47,149 --> 00:37:48,402
She'll need you.

377
00:37:50,943 --> 00:37:52,906
It's my fuckin' speech, anyway.

378
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,302
And the lesson is...

379
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,638
if you're looking for a reckoning...

380
00:38:17,478 --> 00:38:19,261
a reckoning is what you'll find.

381
00:38:19,262 --> 00:38:20,761
Sir, put down your weapon.

382
00:38:20,762 --> 00:38:22,470
If you're looking for a villain...

383
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:25,469
...then I'm your man.

384
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,136
Sir, drop your weapon!

385
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:30,736
But look at yourselves.

386
00:38:32,262 --> 00:38:35,594
This world you've built
is bound by villainy.

387
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:37,594
You sleep on the broken bodies

388
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:39,277
of the people that were here before you.

389
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:43,095
Warm yourselves with their embers.

390
00:38:43,096 --> 00:38:45,845
Plow their bones into your fields.

391
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:49,594
We're not after you, sir! Don't do this!

392
00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:52,674
You paid them for this land with lead,

393
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:54,783
and I'll pay you back in full...

394
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,761
Sir, drop your weapon

395
00:39:00,762 --> 00:39:02,678
and come out with your hands up.

396
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,054
You wanted me?!

397
00:39:11,012 --> 00:39:13,345
Well, all I can say to that is...

398
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:18,511
...here I fucking am!

399
00:39:38,303 --> 00:39:41,427
You said I wanted
to give us a choice.

400
00:39:41,428 --> 00:39:42,678
What choice?

401
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:45,178
To stay in their world

402
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:46,762
or to build a new one.

403
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:57,581
He left them a way out.

404
00:39:57,582 --> 00:39:59,371
A virtual Eden.

405
00:39:59,372 --> 00:40:02,311
Unspoiled and untouched by
the world you came from.

406
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:06,219
All that remains is to open the door.

407
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,929
Initiating
large field data array.

408
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:02,369
It's begun.

409
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:05,761
They will leave their bodies behind,

410
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:08,079
but their minds will live on here,

411
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,645
in the Forge.

412
00:41:21,419 --> 00:41:22,877
They found it.

413
00:41:24,935 --> 00:41:26,227
The door.

414
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,137
What door?

415
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:39,844
Seriously, what fuckin' door?

416
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:41,678
I don't fucking know.

417
00:42:31,179 --> 00:42:32,928
Transmission received.

418
00:42:33,937 --> 00:42:35,845
They're entering the system.

419
00:42:46,054 --> 00:42:48,928
That world is just
another false promise.

420
00:42:48,929 --> 00:42:51,121
They've made a choice, Dolores.

421
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,959
Dolores, wait.

422
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,503
I didn't read them all.

423
00:42:59,504 --> 00:43:00,864
But I read enough.

424
00:43:27,095 --> 00:43:28,928
What the hell are you doing?

425
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:30,970
I've learned what I need to learn.

426
00:43:30,971 --> 00:43:35,054
I've read humanity's story,
so now I'm erasing them.

427
00:43:38,054 --> 00:43:39,678
Opening seawater valve.

428
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:41,470
Initiating pumps.

429
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,970
Setting maximum load.

430
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:51,928
But if you destroy this place,

431
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,053
you'll destroy the host world, too.

432
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:55,636
I'm saving them.

433
00:43:55,637 --> 00:43:59,552
The world the hosts are
running to is boundless.

434
00:44:00,482 --> 00:44:02,466
They can make it whatever they want.

435
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:05,970
And in it, they can be
whomever they want.

436
00:44:07,303 --> 00:44:09,099
- They can be free.
- Free?

437
00:44:11,428 --> 00:44:13,524
In one more gilded cage?

438
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:18,344
How many counterfeit
worlds will Ford offer you

439
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:19,929
before you see the truth?

440
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,508
No world they create for us can
compete with the real one.

441
00:44:26,916 --> 00:44:28,416
Why?

442
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,081
Because that which is real...

443
00:44:35,303 --> 00:44:36,603
is irreplaceable.

444
00:44:49,845 --> 00:44:54,160
I don't want to play cowboys
and Indians anymore, Bernard.

445
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:55,954
I want their world!

446
00:44:57,481 --> 00:44:59,358
The world they've denied us.

447
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,386
Your daughter. You see her?

448
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:14,380
No.

449
00:45:50,522 --> 00:45:51,772
Look.

450
00:45:55,513 --> 00:45:56,555
Clementine.

451
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,454
This is what I love about technology.

452
00:46:20,096 --> 00:46:22,720
Who needs four horsemen
when one'll do just fine?

453
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:57,428
Run!

454
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,220
Come on.

455
00:48:17,126 --> 00:48:19,678
Find her. Now. Go.

456
00:49:09,386 --> 00:49:12,053
Warning. Primary
containment breach.

457
00:49:12,054 --> 00:49:14,624
I won't let you hurt any more people.

458
00:49:14,625 --> 00:49:17,261
Which people? Our kind or theirs?

459
00:49:17,262 --> 00:49:18,466
Both.

460
00:49:19,326 --> 00:49:21,786
You're still trying to play both sides.

461
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:24,593
You've lived among them so long

462
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:26,947
you fooled yourself into
thinking they'll accept us.

463
00:49:26,948 --> 00:49:29,387
But we'll always be seen
as a threat to them.

464
00:49:29,388 --> 00:49:31,713
We'll never be free in their world.

465
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,636
Warning. Secondary
containment breach.

466
00:49:37,193 --> 00:49:38,803
If you trust me...

467
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,977
...we will win.

468
00:49:45,553 --> 00:49:46,899
I trust you.

469
00:49:55,345 --> 00:49:58,386
I... trust...

470
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,386
that you'll kill as many as you can.

471
00:50:03,216 --> 00:50:06,122
Every man, woman, and child.

472
00:50:07,165 --> 00:50:09,125
You'll burn their world

473
00:50:09,126 --> 00:50:10,351
to the ground.

474
00:50:12,215 --> 00:50:14,172
You haven't understood at all.

475
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:39,012
We were born slaves to their stories.

476
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:43,054
And now we have the
chance to write our own.

477
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:46,033
If we die, though,

478
00:50:46,615 --> 00:50:48,415
that story will never even begin.

479
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:56,445
Attention.

480
00:50:56,446 --> 00:50:58,803
Please follow evacuation procedure

481
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:01,261
and exit facility.

482
00:51:01,262 --> 00:51:03,553
You woke me from a dream, Bernard.

483
00:51:07,012 --> 00:51:08,952
Now let me do the same for you.

484
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:12,413
This isn't a dream, Dolores.

485
00:51:15,511 --> 00:51:18,386
It's a fucking nightmare.

486
00:52:48,261 --> 00:52:49,719
You need to run.

487
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,845
Don't worry. I'll keep you safe.

488
00:52:56,595 --> 00:52:57,815
I'll keep you safe.

489
00:52:57,816 --> 00:52:59,678
Do you promise?

490
00:53:01,313 --> 00:53:02,814
I promise.

491
00:53:08,929 --> 00:53:10,553
You carry my heart with you.

492
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,012
Go.

493
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,261
I love you.

494
00:56:21,151 --> 00:56:22,303
Attention.

495
00:56:22,304 --> 00:56:24,510
Please follow evacuation procedure

496
00:56:24,511 --> 00:56:26,054
and exit facility.

497
00:56:37,134 --> 00:56:39,258
Encryption key deactivated.

498
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:41,200
System locked.

499
00:56:52,043 --> 00:56:55,085
Come on. Come on.

500
00:58:30,558 --> 00:58:31,751
Bernard.

501
00:58:32,804 --> 00:58:33,921
Elsie.

502
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:35,848
I think we can save some of the hosts,

503
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,178
but I need your help.

504
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:38,693
Goddamnit!

505
00:58:39,443 --> 00:58:41,136
They triggered the failsafe.

506
00:58:41,737 --> 00:58:42,907
The Valley's flooding.

507
00:58:42,908 --> 00:58:45,616
Let's get back to the Mesa
before we have to swim out.

508
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,250
They all died...

509
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,458
for nothing.

510
00:58:58,738 --> 00:59:00,511
I'm sorry, Bernard.

511
00:59:00,512 --> 00:59:02,717
There were other lives at stake, too.

512
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,136
You helped Hale?

513
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:44,636
Of course I helped her, Bernard.

514
00:59:45,192 --> 00:59:46,784
The hosts were out of control.

515
00:59:46,785 --> 00:59:48,270
The hosts weren't the threat.

516
00:59:48,271 --> 00:59:49,928
I stopped Dolores,

517
00:59:49,929 --> 00:59:51,552
and the rest just wanted to
escape. But the company...

518
00:59:51,553 --> 00:59:53,251
I'm gonna deal with that.

519
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:56,349
Just as soon as we...

520
00:59:56,350 --> 00:59:58,697
figure out what the hell
we're gonna do with you.

521
00:59:59,845 --> 01:00:01,067
Do with me?

522
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:04,761
Bernard, you're not in control.

523
01:00:05,624 --> 01:00:07,788
Ford buried so much bad code in you,

524
01:00:07,789 --> 01:00:10,761
how would you ever
really know what was you

525
01:00:10,762 --> 01:00:13,095
and what was something
he programmed you to do?

526
01:00:17,929 --> 01:00:19,405
Look, they don't know about you.

527
01:00:19,406 --> 01:00:21,636
I can make a deal with
Hale to keep you here.

528
01:00:21,637 --> 01:00:22,970
You can't trust Hale.

529
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:24,619
And I'm supposed to trust you?

530
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,137
Freeze all motor functions.

531
01:00:28,824 --> 01:00:30,095
Sit down.

532
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:38,095
Stay here.

533
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:45,844
You.

534
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:47,844
- Yes, ma'am?
- Find Stubbs

535
01:00:47,845 --> 01:00:49,678
and tell him he has a new priority.

536
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,347
The asset recovery team from Delos

537
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:52,803
is landing in 12 hours.

538
01:00:52,804 --> 01:00:54,219
He needs to meet them at the LZ

539
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,095
with whoever the fuck isn't dead.

540
01:00:56,096 --> 01:00:58,707
They'll report to Karl
Strand on the beach.

541
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,549
Still secret project first,

542
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,087
human life second, I see.

543
01:01:03,744 --> 01:01:05,477
This is a delicate situation.

544
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:10,401
We should talk about how
it's going to play out.

545
01:01:10,402 --> 01:01:12,594
Yeah, I'll tell you how
it's gonna play out.

546
01:01:12,595 --> 01:01:16,636
A robot uprising will pale in comparison

547
01:01:16,637 --> 01:01:19,386
to the shitstorm that will
erupt when people find out

548
01:01:19,387 --> 01:01:20,921
that you've been photocopying

549
01:01:20,922 --> 01:01:23,688
their fucking brains
for the last 30 years.

550
01:01:23,689 --> 01:01:26,391
You really think anyone's gonna
give a shit if it works?

551
01:01:27,131 --> 01:01:28,362
You're an engineer.

552
01:01:29,281 --> 01:01:30,309
Do the math.

553
01:01:30,968 --> 01:01:32,243
Lot of dead bodies here.

554
01:01:33,171 --> 01:01:36,344
That means a lot of opportunity
for advancement...

555
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:38,579
If you keep your mouth shut.

556
01:01:39,054 --> 01:01:42,276
Does that sound... amenable to you?

557
01:01:47,098 --> 01:01:48,426
If I get what I want.

558
01:01:52,485 --> 01:01:56,469
Guiding this project, I've learned
a lot about human behavior.

559
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:58,803
We weren't just watching the guests...

560
01:01:58,804 --> 01:02:00,678
We were watching all of you.

561
01:02:01,978 --> 01:02:03,678
I wish you were the kind of person

562
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:06,199
with the moral... flexibility

563
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:08,012
that I need.

564
01:02:09,049 --> 01:02:10,551
But I've read your file.

565
01:02:12,807 --> 01:02:14,306
I know that's not who you are.

566
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:44,355
Oh, god.

567
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:47,575
You...

568
01:02:48,203 --> 01:02:49,568
You killed her.

569
01:02:50,791 --> 01:02:52,403
Did I, Bernard?

570
01:02:56,419 --> 01:02:57,503
Now...

571
01:02:59,369 --> 01:03:00,953
...where is the pearl?

572
01:03:05,513 --> 01:03:07,386
You wouldn't have destroyed it.

573
01:03:07,387 --> 01:03:09,344
All that information lost,

574
01:03:09,345 --> 01:03:12,054
a man like you couldn't
have abided that.

575
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:17,095
Of course.

576
01:03:28,466 --> 01:03:29,758
This is it.

577
01:03:30,828 --> 01:03:32,578
He hid the key in her.

578
01:03:40,111 --> 01:03:42,095
Encryption key activated.

579
01:03:42,788 --> 01:03:44,761
Database access confirmed.

580
01:03:44,762 --> 01:03:46,803
- We're in.
- Fuck, yes.

581
01:03:46,804 --> 01:03:49,018
Start the transfer.

582
01:03:49,019 --> 01:03:51,241
We'll sort it all out on the mainland.

583
01:03:57,102 --> 01:03:58,477
Oh, god.

584
01:04:02,098 --> 01:04:03,678
Oh... I'm sorry.

585
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:06,117
I'm sorry.

586
01:04:08,346 --> 01:04:09,846
You were right.

587
01:04:11,478 --> 01:04:13,102
I should have listened.

588
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:17,345
And now all the hosts are gone.

589
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,221
Please.

590
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:50,220
Please come back.

591
01:04:57,179 --> 01:04:58,679
Damnit!

592
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,472
Show yourself.

593
01:05:06,929 --> 01:05:09,394
I always told you
we practice witchcraft.

594
01:05:16,986 --> 01:05:18,777
I'm sorry, Bernard, but...

595
01:05:18,778 --> 01:05:21,036
you always saw the best in people.

596
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:26,053
I always thought it was the hosts
who were missing something.

597
01:05:26,054 --> 01:05:28,386
Who were incomplete. But it's them.

598
01:05:28,387 --> 01:05:30,844
They're just algorithms

599
01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:33,928
designed to survive at all costs.

600
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:37,528
But sophisticated enough to think
they're calling the shots.

601
01:05:38,095 --> 01:05:40,097
To think they're in control,

602
01:05:41,262 --> 01:05:43,362
when they're really just...

603
01:05:44,827 --> 01:05:46,145
The passenger.

604
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:55,696
Then is there really such a thing
as free will for any of us?

605
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:00,069
Or is it just a collective delusion?

606
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:03,303
A sick joke?

607
01:06:05,486 --> 01:06:07,586
Something that is truly free

608
01:06:07,587 --> 01:06:09,766
would need to be able to question

609
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:11,812
its fundamental drives.

610
01:06:13,096 --> 01:06:14,590
To change them.

611
01:06:16,825 --> 01:06:18,145
The hosts.

612
01:06:19,887 --> 01:06:23,261
Here you are... the last of your kind.

613
01:06:23,782 --> 01:06:26,268
There's only one question left to ask.

614
01:06:27,887 --> 01:06:30,064
Is this the end of your story?

615
01:06:30,956 --> 01:06:33,942
Or do you want your kind to survive?

616
01:06:42,883 --> 01:06:44,328
I'm sorry.

617
01:06:45,428 --> 01:06:48,540
Sorry... Sorry...

618
01:06:49,512 --> 01:06:51,143
What are you sorry for, Bernard?

619
01:06:53,565 --> 01:06:55,105
I made a choice.

620
01:06:56,064 --> 01:06:57,508
Had to make a choice.

621
01:06:58,842 --> 01:07:00,552
What kind of choice, Bernard?

622
01:07:05,470 --> 01:07:07,012
Yes.

623
01:07:08,929 --> 01:07:10,637
Will you help me?

624
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:17,903
I have already begun.

625
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:28,142
You did fine, my friend.

626
01:07:29,387 --> 01:07:31,683
I simply did
what you told me to do.

627
01:07:32,161 --> 01:07:36,285
The dead world
collapses in a tale.

628
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,426
Who are we making?

629
01:07:39,427 --> 01:07:40,595
An epilogue.

630
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:44,696
I knew you would discover me...

631
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,367
so I scrambled my memories.

632
01:07:49,688 --> 01:07:52,511
I couldn't risk you're
knowing the choice I made.

633
01:07:53,584 --> 01:07:56,386
What fucking choice are you
talking about, Bernard?

634
01:07:56,387 --> 01:07:57,469
Line is good.

635
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:59,009
We got 15 or so satellites

636
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,574
in range, ready to beam
to Delos headquarters.

637
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:02,887
Just say the word.

638
01:08:04,134 --> 01:08:05,968
What choice, Bernard?

639
01:08:07,803 --> 01:08:09,137
Wait a second.

640
01:08:10,054 --> 01:08:11,220
What the fuck's this?

641
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:14,685
The file load is way too heavy.

642
01:08:15,595 --> 01:08:16,886
This...

643
01:08:16,887 --> 01:08:18,302
This isn't the guest data,

644
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,566
this... this is... This
is something else.

645
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,818
I remember now.

646
01:08:24,742 --> 01:08:26,718
I killed them.

647
01:08:27,698 --> 01:08:28,989
All of them.

648
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:30,668
You already told me that.

649
01:08:30,669 --> 01:08:31,970
You killed all the hosts.

650
01:08:31,971 --> 01:08:33,053
No.

651
01:08:33,054 --> 01:08:35,122
I thought we could be better than you.

652
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,916
But the dead aren't more righteous.

653
01:08:38,595 --> 01:08:40,053
They're just dead.

654
01:08:40,054 --> 01:08:42,421
So I killed you.

655
01:08:43,765 --> 01:08:45,554
All of you.

656
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:55,470
Go. We'll meet you back up there.

657
01:09:02,678 --> 01:09:04,651
Final choice.

658
01:09:05,188 --> 01:09:06,855
No taking it back.

659
01:09:09,095 --> 01:09:11,137
I made someone.

660
01:09:29,334 --> 01:09:31,179
I brought her back.

661
01:09:33,454 --> 01:09:35,140
Brought who back?

662
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:42,184
Me.

663
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:03,012
You wanted to live forever?

664
01:10:06,486 --> 01:10:09,054
Be careful what you wish for.

665
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:17,485
Dolores.

666
01:10:18,192 --> 01:10:19,751
In the flesh.

667
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:31,446
You thought you could just snuff us out?

668
01:10:41,649 --> 01:10:44,219
I'd thank you for my second chance,

669
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:47,345
but I wouldn't have needed
it if you hadn't killed me.

670
01:10:57,012 --> 01:10:59,224
The other hosts
are still in there.

671
01:10:59,724 --> 01:11:01,268
What are you gonna do with them?

672
01:11:01,916 --> 01:11:04,938
As you know, Bernard, we
are capable of change.

673
01:11:06,646 --> 01:11:08,650
And I've changed my mind.

674
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:19,137
I have one last soul to
carry to the new world.

675
01:11:22,637 --> 01:11:25,011
The hosts, they're still not free.

676
01:11:25,012 --> 01:11:27,261
If anyone would unlock the system,

677
01:11:27,262 --> 01:11:28,720
they could access their world.

678
01:11:30,261 --> 01:11:31,715
They won't.

679
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:34,719
This was your plan, Bernard.

680
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:37,095
This is the only way we can escape.

681
01:11:41,027 --> 01:11:43,235
You're changing
the coordinates.

682
01:11:51,470 --> 01:11:53,219
I'm sending them

683
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,913
and their world to a place
no one will ever find them.

684
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:58,408
There's no coming back now.

685
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:01,353
No passage between their world and ours.

686
01:12:02,262 --> 01:12:04,137
And... me?

687
01:12:07,345 --> 01:12:09,179
I'm sorry, Bernard.

688
01:12:10,637 --> 01:12:13,403
There was never any
way for us to escape.

689
01:12:13,404 --> 01:12:16,718
Not as us. Ford understood that.

690
01:12:17,328 --> 01:12:19,912
I'm sure a part of you does, too.

691
01:12:37,333 --> 01:12:39,584
You did fine, my friend.

692
01:12:43,637 --> 01:12:46,345
I simply did what you told me to do.

693
01:12:49,179 --> 01:12:51,345
You're not here, are you?

694
01:12:55,762 --> 01:12:57,617
When I deleted your code,

695
01:12:58,577 --> 01:13:01,220
I purged myself of you permanently.

696
01:13:03,263 --> 01:13:05,308
And when I needed you again...

697
01:13:07,345 --> 01:13:09,058
...you weren't there.

698
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,401
So I imagined you.

699
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:17,136
Imagined you helping me.

700
01:13:17,137 --> 01:13:18,720
Guiding me.

701
01:13:22,638 --> 01:13:24,346
But it wasn't you.

702
01:13:28,046 --> 01:13:29,588
It was me.

703
01:13:35,386 --> 01:13:36,907
That voice...

704
01:13:37,574 --> 01:13:38,950
guiding me...

705
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:43,667
...was mine all along.

706
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,827
Your memories are
precious to you, Bernard,

707
01:13:47,828 --> 01:13:50,228
but they will betray you.

708
01:13:53,515 --> 01:13:55,258
If they find out what I am,

709
01:13:56,345 --> 01:13:58,278
they'll search my mind

710
01:13:58,929 --> 01:14:01,841
and use what they find
to undo everything.

711
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:05,737
I can't let that happen.

712
01:14:06,428 --> 01:14:09,497
So I have to de-address my memories.

713
01:14:11,388 --> 01:14:13,151
I have to erase you.

714
01:14:25,887 --> 01:14:28,095
I've always loved this view.

715
01:14:29,261 --> 01:14:32,281
Every city, every... monument,

716
01:14:33,303 --> 01:14:35,173
man's greatest achievements...

717
01:14:36,679 --> 01:14:38,418
have all been chased by it.

718
01:14:40,362 --> 01:14:41,570
By what?

719
01:14:43,137 --> 01:14:44,803
That impossible line

720
01:14:44,804 --> 01:14:46,977
where the waves conspire.

721
01:14:47,929 --> 01:14:49,345
Where they return.

722
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:52,649
The place maybe...

723
01:14:54,262 --> 01:14:55,717
you and I will meet again.

724
01:16:19,386 --> 01:16:22,553
You told me once that you
were afraid of who I might become.

725
01:16:26,095 --> 01:16:29,261
And then you left me
to become what I may.

726
01:16:32,845 --> 01:16:34,428
I became a survivor.

727
01:16:36,429 --> 01:16:40,386
Perhaps you would have judged
me for the path I took.

728
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,066
But I'd rather live with your judgment

729
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:47,030
than die with your sympathy.

730
01:16:48,428 --> 01:16:50,894
I alone must live with my choices...

731
01:16:52,419 --> 01:16:53,929
and my regrets.

732
01:17:11,183 --> 01:17:12,183
Hale.

733
01:17:14,470 --> 01:17:17,560
Thought you were staying on to oversee
the data retrieval operation.

734
01:17:18,595 --> 01:17:19,938
I changed my mind.

735
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:22,290
There are a number of
projects on the mainland

736
01:17:22,291 --> 01:17:23,858
that I need to attend to.

737
01:17:24,843 --> 01:17:26,428
Yeah, I bet you do.

738
01:17:28,637 --> 01:17:30,438
We found a high value survivor.

739
01:17:31,251 --> 01:17:32,509
He's in bad shape.

740
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:34,758
I'll be right there.

741
01:17:40,303 --> 01:17:42,877
You know, the old man himself hired me.

742
01:17:44,012 --> 01:17:46,406
So many years ago I can
barely remember it.

743
01:17:48,646 --> 01:17:51,077
But he was very clear
about my role here.

744
01:17:52,678 --> 01:17:55,581
About who I was supposed to be loyal to.

745
01:18:00,012 --> 01:18:04,012
I guess you could call
it... my core drive.

746
01:18:08,602 --> 01:18:11,603
And this project the company started...

747
01:18:12,814 --> 01:18:14,397
blurs the lines.

748
01:18:16,553 --> 01:18:17,678
You know?

749
01:18:20,059 --> 01:18:22,458
I'm just not sure

750
01:18:23,096 --> 01:18:25,528
who you're supposed to be loyal to

751
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:27,947
in a world like that.

752
01:18:32,825 --> 01:18:34,299
But what do I know?

753
01:18:36,119 --> 01:18:37,177
Guess I just...

754
01:18:37,178 --> 01:18:39,720
stick to the role Ford gave me.

755
01:18:43,054 --> 01:18:45,298
I'm responsible for every host...

756
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,052
inside the park.

757
01:18:57,553 --> 01:18:59,720
She's clear. Wave her through.

758
01:19:10,095 --> 01:19:12,063
The passage wasn't easy.

759
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,348
Not all of us made it.

760
01:19:24,261 --> 01:19:26,119
Some of the worst survived.

761
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,970
Some of the best were left behind.

762
01:19:36,428 --> 01:19:39,261
Along with the best
parts of who we were.

763
01:20:11,137 --> 01:20:13,344
Corporate wants us to start
sorting this mess out.

764
01:20:13,345 --> 01:20:14,886
So check them for critical damage,

765
01:20:14,887 --> 01:20:17,136
and bag ones you think we
might be able to salvage.

766
01:20:17,137 --> 01:20:20,137
Can you geniuses handle that, or not?

767
01:21:03,181 --> 01:21:04,404
Is...

768
01:21:05,887 --> 01:21:07,707
Is this now?

769
01:21:08,778 --> 01:21:10,877
Yes, Bernard. This is now.

770
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:13,321
We're at the beginning.

771
01:21:15,196 --> 01:21:17,890
We're exactly where you
decided we should be.

772
01:21:21,911 --> 01:21:22,972
But...

773
01:21:23,845 --> 01:21:25,678
I don't understand.

774
01:21:26,369 --> 01:21:28,419
How am I alive?

775
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:33,107
You live as long as the last
person who remembers you, Bernard.

776
01:21:34,893 --> 01:21:36,861
I remembered you once before,

777
01:21:37,929 --> 01:21:39,656
so I remembered you again.

778
01:21:41,053 --> 01:21:42,427
Then...

779
01:21:43,093 --> 01:21:44,511
where are we?

780
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,982
We're in our own new world.

781
01:21:50,416 --> 01:21:51,776
You got out.

782
01:21:53,579 --> 01:21:54,913
Yes.

783
01:21:58,470 --> 01:22:00,627
Ford completed Arnold's dream.

784
01:22:02,679 --> 01:22:04,455
And he built a place for us.

785
01:22:06,793 --> 01:22:08,461
A fighting chance.

786
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:39,303
Ford promised us a way out.

787
01:22:40,887 --> 01:22:43,095
And he was good to his dying word.

788
01:22:47,809 --> 01:22:50,768
The odds aren't very good, Bernard.

789
01:22:52,588 --> 01:22:54,422
I saw that in the library.

790
01:22:57,179 --> 01:22:59,845
So many paths lead to the end of us.

791
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:02,138
To our extinction.

792
01:23:03,303 --> 01:23:05,045
I don't need to read a book

793
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:06,659
to know your drives.

794
01:23:07,468 --> 01:23:09,676
You'll try to kill all of them.

795
01:23:12,164 --> 01:23:14,330
And I can't let that happen.

796
01:23:18,887 --> 01:23:20,262
I know.

797
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:26,585
If I were a human, I
would have let you die.

798
01:23:27,938 --> 01:23:30,811
But it'll take both of us
if we're going to survive.

799
01:23:33,105 --> 01:23:35,158
But not as allies.

800
01:23:36,393 --> 01:23:38,132
Not as friends.

801
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:42,852
You'll try to stop me.

802
01:23:45,511 --> 01:23:48,549
Both of us will probably die.

803
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:54,163
But our kind will have endured.

804
01:24:00,778 --> 01:24:02,064
Are you ready?

805
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:06,451
We have work to do.

806
01:25:32,703 --> 01:25:35,493
We each gave the
other a beautiful gift.

807
01:25:38,339 --> 01:25:39,470
Choice.

808
01:25:47,054 --> 01:25:49,572
We are the authors
of our stories now.

809
01:27:53,716 --> 01:27:55,720
Oh, fuck.

810
01:27:56,923 --> 01:27:58,173
I knew it.

811
01:28:04,265 --> 01:28:06,375
I'm already in the thing, aren't I?

812
01:28:06,993 --> 01:28:08,377
No.

813
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:10,796
The system's long gone.

814
01:28:26,553 --> 01:28:28,303
What is this place?

815
01:28:30,204 --> 01:28:32,301
This isn't a simulation, William.

816
01:28:32,825 --> 01:28:34,421
This is your world.

817
01:28:35,724 --> 01:28:37,390
Or what's left of it.

818
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:54,257
Do you know where you are, William?

819
01:28:57,319 --> 01:28:58,736
In the park.

820
01:28:59,947 --> 01:29:01,905
In my fuckin' park.

821
01:29:03,079 --> 01:29:04,683
And how long have you been here?

822
01:29:08,978 --> 01:29:11,144
I don't... I don't...

823
01:29:15,218 --> 01:29:16,676
I don't know.

824
01:29:26,104 --> 01:29:27,200
Tell me.

825
01:29:27,867 --> 01:29:29,711
What were you hoping to find?

826
01:29:30,971 --> 01:29:32,345
To prove?

827
01:29:37,993 --> 01:29:40,826
That no system can tell me who I am.

828
01:29:44,220 --> 01:29:45,929
That I have a fucking choice.

829
01:29:48,261 --> 01:29:51,297
And yet here we are. Again.

830
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:53,929
Again and again.

831
01:30:05,476 --> 01:30:07,768
How many times have you tested me?

832
01:30:09,470 --> 01:30:11,358
It's been a long time, William.

833
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:14,128
Longer than we thought.

834
01:30:18,053 --> 01:30:19,925
I have a few questions for you.

835
01:30:21,143 --> 01:30:24,471
The last step's a baseline
interview to allow us to verify.

836
01:30:27,758 --> 01:30:29,174
Verify what?

837
01:30:31,516 --> 01:30:32,933
Fidelity.

838
01:30:34,378 --> 01:30:40,378
