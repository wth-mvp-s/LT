# Energy Consumption Analysis

## LED Lamp:
- **Power**: 0.3W
- **Daily Energy Consumption**: \(\frac{0.3W \times 24 \text{hours}}{1000} = 0.0072 \text{kWh/day}\)
- **Monthly Energy Consumption (30 days)**: 0.216 kWh
- **Monthly Energy Cost**: 0.216 kWh * 0.19 €/kWh = 0.04104 €

## Foxter:
- **Power**: 7W
- **Daily Energy Consumption**: \(\frac{7W \times 24 \text{hours}}{1000} = 0.168 \text{kWh/day}\)
- **Monthly Energy Consumption (30 days)**: 5.04 kWh
- **Monthly Energy Cost**: 5.04 kWh * 0.19 €/kWh = 0.9568 €

## IKEA Lamp:
- **Power**: 5.9W
- **Daily Energy Consumption**: \(\frac{5.9W \times 24 \text{hours}}{1000} = 0.1416 \text{kWh/day}\)
- **Monthly Energy Consumption (30 days)**: 4.248 kWh
- **Monthly Energy Cost**: 4.248 kWh * 0.19 €/kWh = 0.80712 €

## Philips Lamp:
- **Power**: 15W
- **Daily Energy Consumption**: \(\frac{15W \times 24 \text{hours}}{1000} = 0.36 \text{kWh/day}\)
- **Monthly Energy Consumption (30 days)**: 10.8 kWh
- **Monthly Energy Cost**: 10.8 kWh * 0.19 €/kWh = 2.052 €

---

From the calculations above, you can clearly see that the energy costs vary with the power of the lamps. The Philips lamp, being the highest wattage, has the highest energy cost, while the LED lamp with only 0.3W has the lowest energy cost.

However, keep in mind that the subscription cost (7.84 €) remains constant regardless of the energy usage. It's the energy cost that adds variability.

# Economical Alternatives to Philips Lamp

When seeking economical alternatives to a particular lamp, it's essential to consider several factors:

## Factors to Consider:

1. **Wattage**: A lower wattage typically means reduced energy consumption, resulting in energy cost savings.
2. **Lumens**: This metric measures brightness. Aim for a bulb that offers the required brightness (lumens) but consumes less power (lower wattage).
3. **Lifespan**: LEDs usually outlast traditional incandescent or CFL bulbs. A longer-lasting bulb might have a higher initial cost but can offer savings in the long run due to reduced replacement frequency.
4. **Energy Efficiency**: Opt for bulbs with recognized energy efficiency ratings or certifications, such as ENERGY STAR.
5. **Type of Bulb**: LEDs are generally more energy-efficient than CFLs, halogens, or incandescent bulbs.

## Potential Alternatives:

1. **LED Bulbs**: These are notably more energy-efficient. An LED producing lumens equivalent to the 15W Philips lamp might only require 5-8W, leading to significant energy savings.
2. **CFL (Compact Fluorescent Lamp)**: Consuming more power than LEDs but less than traditional bulbs, CFLs can be a viable option where LEDs are unsuitable or expensive. However, they contain trace amounts of mercury, necessitating special disposal.
3. **Smart Bulbs**: Controlled remotely (usually via a smartphone app), these bulbs offer features like dimming, scheduling, and color changing. Precise control can lead to energy savings.
4. **Solar-Powered Lamps (for outdoor use)**: Suitable for external applications, these lamps have no subsequent energy costs after the initial investment since they rely on sunlight.
5. **Dimmer Switches**: Although not a direct bulb alternative, dimmer switches let you modulate brightness as required, saving energy when full luminosity isn't needed.
6. **Brands**: Numerous brands, such as Osram, GE, Cree, and more, offer energy-efficient bulbs. It might be beneficial to compare different brand offerings.

In conclusion, when selecting an economical alternative, weigh both the initial expenditure and long-term energy cost savings. A bulb with a higher upfront cost can still be cost-effective in the long run if it's energy-efficient or durable.
