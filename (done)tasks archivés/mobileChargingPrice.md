Maximum Power Draw of the Charger: P=V×I
P=5V×2A=10W
This means your charger can draw a maximum of 10 Watts.

Energy Consumption: If you were to charge your phone for 1 hour at maximum power draw:
E=P×t
E=10W×1h=10Wh=0.01kWh

Cost: If you know the cost per kWh of electricity in your area, you can multiply that by the energy consumption to get the cost. For example, if electricity costs $0.12 per kWh:
Cost = 0.01kWh \times $0.12/kWh = $0.0012

Initial Charging Phase: 
    During the initial phase, when your phone's battery is not full, it will draw power to charge the battery. During this time, you will be paying for the electricity the charger uses to charge the phone.

Trickle Charging Phase: 
    Once the battery reaches near 100%, many modern smartphones and chargers switch to a "trickle charge" mode. In this mode, the charger delivers a very small amount of power to keep the battery at 100% while compensating for the small natural discharge of the battery. This power is much less than the maximum power output of the charger.

Idle Phase: 
    If your phone has a smart charging circuit (and many modern phones do), once the battery is fully charged, the phone might stop drawing power altogether or draw a negligible amount to power the phone's standby operations. The charger itself might consume a small amount of power (often referred to as "phantom load" or "vampire power") just by being plugged into the wall, even if it's not actively charging the phone.
