<!-- 
To count the commits from a given month using Git, you can use the git rev-list command in combination with the --since and --until options, followed by piping the output to wc -l, which counts the number of lines (and therefore the number of commits). -->

git rev-list --count --since="May 1, 2022" --until="June 1, 2022" HEAD
