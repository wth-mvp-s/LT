Aperture Priority Mode (A):
Purpose: Control depth of field.
How it works: You set the aperture, and the camera adjusts the shutter speed.
Ideal for: Still subjects, capturing details, and creating a shallow depth of field.
Shutter Priority Mode (S):
Purpose: Control motion blur.
How it works: You choose the shutter speed, and the camera adjusts the aperture.
Ideal for: Capturing moving subjects or scenes with varying motion.
Program Mode (P):
Purpose: Balanced automatic settings with some creative control.
How it works: The camera selects both aperture and shutter speed, but you can adjust them as needed.
Ideal for: General shooting when you want a balance between control and automation.
For photos in a gallery or museum where the lighting is likely consistent and subjects are static, you can choose Aperture Priority Mode (A) to control depth of field and ensure sharp, well-exposed images. This mode allows you to focus on capturing details and making the most of the available light without worrying about motion blur.
