`In the Azure portal you see that messages are being sent to the subscription for each topic. You create and initialize a subscription client object by supplying the correct details, but the subscription application is still not consuming the messages.
`You need to ensure that the subscription client processes all messages.
`Which code segment should you use?

- [ ] await subscriptionClient.AddRuleAsync(new RuleDescription(RuleDescription.DefaultRuleName, new TrueFilter()));
- [ ] subscriptionClient = new SubscriptionClient(ServiceBusConnectionString, TopicName, SubscriptionName);
- [ ] await subscriptionClient.CloseAsync();
- [x] subscriptionClient.RegisterMessageHandler(ProcessMessagesAsync, messageHandlerOptions);


#### Qp. 16 [15voters]::You are developing an Azure Service application that processes queue data when it receives a message from a mobile application. Messages may not be sent to the service consistently.
`You have the following requirements:
`â Queue size must not grow larger than 80 gigabytes (GB).
`â Use first-in-first-out (FIFO) ordering of messages.
`â Minimize Azure costs.
`You need to implement the messaging solution.
`Solution: Use the .Net API to add a message to an Azure Storage Queue from the mobile application. 
`Create an Azure VM that is triggered from Azure Storage Queue events.
`Does the solution meet the goal?
