	problem scenario : 
		When administrators connect to remote VMs, they typically use either RDP or SSH to achieve their administrative goals. The problem is, to connect to a hosted VM, you must connect to its public IP address. However, exposing the IP ports used by RDP and SSH (3389 and 22) to the internet is highly undesirable, because it presents significant security risks.
		
	solve problem: 
		- withstand attacks.
		- Provides RDP and SSH connectivity
	how it work: 
		TCP 443
		Bastion and connected VM are in diffirent subnets
	downside ? 
	when to use: 
		- avoid using jump box
