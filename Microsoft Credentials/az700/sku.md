# Focusing on the SKU requirements for various Azure services relevant to the AZ-700 (Designing and Implementing Microsoft Azure Networking Solutions) certification, let's explore these in the context of networking features:

### 1. **Azure Public IP Addresses (including NAT Gateway)**
- **NAT Gateway**: Requires **Standard SKU** public IP addresses; Basic SKU is not supported. The IP addresses must also be **Static**.
- **General**: Azure services that utilize public IP addresses typically recommend or require the Standard SKU for scenarios demanding higher security, availability, and support for Azure features like Availability Zones.

### 2. **Azure Load Balancer**
- **Basic**: Provides simple load balancing for services with modest needs without requiring a public IP address. Does not support Availability Zones.
- **Standard**: Offers enhanced security features, support for Availability Zones, and a higher scale. Requires Standard SKU public IP addresses for internet-facing load balancers.

### 3. **Azure VPN Gateway**
- SKU is primarily differentiated by **VPN throughput and tunnels**:
  - **Basic**: Offers a lower performance level suitable for small to medium-sized businesses.
  - **VpnGw1, VpnGw2, VpnGw3**: These SKUs provide progressively higher throughput and simultaneous connections, suitable for enterprise-scale solutions. Standard SKU public IP addresses are required.

### 4. **Azure ExpressRoute**
- ExpressRoute services are categorized by **bandwidths** rather than SKUs in the traditional sense, ranging from 50 Mbps to 100 Gbps. However, certain features like ExpressRoute Direct require specific considerations related to the scaling and performance capabilities.

### 5. **Azure Application Gateway**
- **Standard**: Supports basic application gateway functions.
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall) Standard**: In addition to the capabilities of the Standard SKU, it includes protection against web vulnerabilities and attacks.
- **Standard_v2 and WAF_v2**: These SKUs offer additional features, including autoscaling and zone redundancy for higher availability and performance.

### 6. **Azure Front Door**
- **Standard and Premium (in preview at last update)**: These SKUs differentiate in terms of security and acceleration features. The Premium SKU offers advanced security features, such as Web Application Firewall capabilities integrated into the service.

### 7. **Azure Firewall**
- **Standard**: Provides essential firewall capabilities.
- **Premium**: Offers enhanced features, including TLS inspection, IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems), and web categories.

When planning and implementing solutions for the AZ-700 certification, understanding these SKU differences is crucial. Each SKU's capabilities, limitations, and support for Azure's advanced networking features can significantly impact the design and efficiency of your network architecture within Azure.




# In Azure, different services offer various SKUs to cater to diverse needs, ranging from basic to more advanced requirements. Here's a simplified overview of common SKU categories and their differentiating factors, focusing on a few Azure services for illustration:

1. Azure Public IP Addresses
Basic: Offers basic features like dynamic or static IP allocation. Does not support Availability Zones, IP tags, or zone-redundant configuration.
Standard: Provides enhanced capabilities such as secure by default and zone-redundant configurations, support for Availability Zones, and the requirement for associated network security group (NSG) rules for inbound traffic.
2. Azure Virtual Machines
SKUs here differentiate by size (e.g., B-series, D-series, E-series) focusing on various aspects like compute, memory, storage, and more, catering to different workload types from development and testing to memory-intensive applications.
3. Azure SQL Database
DTU-based (Basic, Standard, Premium): Pre-configured bundles of compute resources and storage. Each tier is designed to support a different level of application performance.
vCore-based (General Purpose, Business Critical, Hyperscale): Provides more flexibility and control over compute, memory, and storage settings, along with higher performance and scalability options.
4. Azure Storage
Standard: Supports blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks with magnetic storage media, aimed at general-purpose storage needs.
Premium: Offers higher performance, especially for Azure Virtual Machine disks, with solid-state drives (SSDs).
5. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Differentiates primarily through the VM sizes (SKU of the underlying nodes) rather than a direct AKS service SKU.
Differentiation Factors
Performance: Higher SKUs typically offer better performance capabilities.
Features: Advanced features are usually available in higher SKUs.
Price: Higher SKUs come with higher costs, given the enhanced features and performance.
Availability: Some SKUs offer higher availability and redundancy features, like support for Availability Zones.
Selecting the right SKU depends on balancing the requirements of your workload, including performance, features, and budget constraints. Azure's flexible SKU options allow for tailored configurations to match diverse application needs and scalability demands.
