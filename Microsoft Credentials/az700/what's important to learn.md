# What is NAT, and his requirements:

when deploying a NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway in Azure, the requirements for public IP addresses include that they must be:

Static IP addresses: Dynamic IP addresses cannot be used with NAT gateways.
Standard SKU: The Basic SKU public IP addresses are not supported by NAT gateways.

Azure's network architecture and its various components have specific requirements and capabilities, especially when configuring advanced networking scenarios like routing through an Azure Firewall using virtual network peering. The error stemmed from incorrectly assessing the role and configuration requirements of the "enable remote gateway" setting in such a scenario.

Accurately providing guidance on Azure networking involves careful consideration of these nuances, and I aim to provide the most accurate and helpful information possible. Misunderstandings or inaccuracies in my responses are opportunities for clarification and further learning.

    The enable remote gateway setting in virtual network peering is crucial when you want to route traffic through a specific virtual network's gateway, including scenarios involving Azure Firewall. When VNet1 hosts the firewall and VNet2 needs to route its internet-bound traffic through this firewall, enabling the remote gateway setting on VNet2's peering to VNet1 is necessary. This configuration allows VNet2 to leverage the gateway (in this case, the Azure Firewall in VNet1) for its outbound traffic.
    Given this understanding, the correct approach to ensure that VM2 in VNet2 can access the internet via Firewall1 in VNet1 indeed involves enabling the remote gateway setting on the peering from VNet2 to VNet1. This ensures that traffic from VNet2 (where VM2 resides) can be routed through Firewall1 located in VNet1.

    Therefore, the corrected statement should be:

    The enable remote gateway setting must be enabled on the virtual net peering to provide VM2 Internet access by using Firewall1. : Yes
