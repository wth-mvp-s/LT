#### Q164. ::
`Which responsibility belongs to AWS when a company hosts its databases on Amazon EC2 instances?

- [ ] Database backups
- [ ] Database software patches
- [ ] Operating system patches
- [x] Operating system installations.

When you choose to use EC2 for your database, you first have to provision the EC2 instance, which means you will use an AMI, containing the OS itself which is then installed by AWS to the EC2. All the other tasks are your responsibility.
