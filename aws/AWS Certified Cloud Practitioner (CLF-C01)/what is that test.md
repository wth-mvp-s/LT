                    ?? `A company has a workload that requires data to be collected, analyzed, and stored on premises. The company wants to extend the use of AWS services to run on premises with access to the company network and the company's VPC.

stateful firewall :: more advanced than stateless firewalls, tracks the state of network connections passing through it (Security groups)

stateless firewall :: decision based on the individual packets of data being transmitted

Amazon Aurora :: sql bdd, speed and reliability

Amazon Inspector  :: network security of EC2

Inherited Controls â€“ Controls which a customer fully inherits from AWS.

Physical and Environmental controls

Auto Scaling :: scale the number of instances in your application

Global Accelerator :: route traffic to the optimal location for the best performance.

Amazon Athena :: sql query service to analyze data, ideal for S3, and does not require any infrastructure

network access control list (ACL) ::allows or denies specific inbound or outbound traffic at the subnet level.

Security groups :: instance-level firewall to control inbound and outbound access?

KMS (Key Management Service ) ::gives you centralized control over the cryptographic keys used to protect your data. 

AWS Transit Gateway:: connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub. 

DDoS attacks :: Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks are a subclass of denial of service (DoS) attacks. A DDoS attack involves multiple connected online devices, collectively known as a botnet, which are used to overwhelm a target website with fake traffic.

trusted advisor :: `A user wants to identify any security group that is allowing unrestricted incoming SSH traffic.
