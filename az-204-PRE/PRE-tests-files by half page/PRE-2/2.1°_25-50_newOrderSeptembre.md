#### 0031, [67%] ::You are developing an application that applies a set of governance policies for internal and external services, as well as for applications.
`You develop a stateful ASP.NET Core 2.1 web application named PolicyApp and deploy it to an Azure App Service Web App. 
`The PolicyApp reacts to events from Azure Event Grid and performs policy actions based on those events.
`You have the following requirements:
`✑ Authentication events must be used to monitor users when they sign in and sign out.
`✑ All authentication events must be processed by PolicyApp.
`✑ Sign outs must be processed as fast as possible.
`What should you do?

- [ ] Create a new Azure Event Grid subscription for all authentication events. Use the subscription to process sign-out events.
- [ ] Create a separate Azure Event Grid handler for sign-in and sign-out events.
- [ ] Create separate Azure Event Grid topics and subscriptions for sign-in and sign-out events. 
- [x] Add a subject prefix to sign-out events. Create an Azure Event Grid subscription. Configure the subscription to use the subjectBeginsWith filter.

#### 0033, Q1. [ok]::You are implementing a software as a service (SaaS) ASP.NET Core web service that will run as an Azure Web App. The web service will use an on-premises SQL Server database for storage. The web service also includes a WebJob that processes data updates. Four customers will use the web service. 
`✑ Each instance of the WebJob processes data for a single customer and must run as a singleton instance.
`✑ Each deployment must be tested by using deployment slots prior to serving production data.
`✑ Azure costs must be minimized.
`✑ Azure resources must be located in an isolated network.
`You need to configure the App Service plan for the Web App.

#### 0034, Q2. ::You are a developer for a software as a service (SaaS) company that uses an Azure Function to process orders. The Azure Function currently runs on an Azure
`Function app that is triggered by an Azure Storage queue.
`You are preparing to migrate the Azure Function to Kubernetes using Kubernetes-based Event Driven Autoscaling (KEDA).
`You need to configure Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) for the Azure Function.
`Which CRDs should you configure? To answer, drag the appropriate CRD types to the correct locations. Each CRD type may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
