#### Q32 [//]4QuestionPareil::You develop a software as a service (SaaS) offering to manage photographs. Users upload photos to a web service which then stores the photos in Azure Storage Blob storage. The storage account type is General-purpose V2.
`When photos are uploaded, they must be processed to produce and save a mobile-friendly version of the image. The process to produce a mobile-friendly version of the image must start in less than one minute.
`You need to design the process that starts the photo processing.
`Solution: Create an Azure Function app that uses the Consumption hosting model and that is triggered from the blob upload.
`Does the solution meet the goal?

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No
