#### Q15.1? ::You are building a traffic monitoring system that monitors traffic along six highways. The system produces time series analysis-based reports for each highway.
`Data from traffic sensors are stored in Azure Event Hub.
`Traffic data is consumed by four departments. Each department has an Azure Web App that displays the time series-based reports and contains a WebJob that processes the incoming data from Event Hub. All Web Apps run on App Service Plans with three instances.
`Data throughput must be maximized. Latency must be minimized.
`You need to implement the Azure Event Hub.
`Which settings should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
`
`Number of partitions

- [ ] 3

#### Q16 ::You are developing a microservices solution. You plan to deploy the solution to a multinode Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
`You need to deploy a solution that includes the following features:
`✑ reverse proxy capabilities
`✑ configurable traffic routing
`✑ TLS termination with a custom certificate
`Which components should you use? To answer, drag the appropriate components to the correct requirements. Each component may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

#### Q19p14.2 ::You are developing an Azure Cosmos DB solution by using the Azure Cosmos DB SQL API. The data includes millions of documents. Each document may contain hundreds of properties.
`The properties of the documents do not contain distinct values for partitioning. Azure Cosmos DB must scale individual containers in the database to meet the performance needs of the application by spreading the workload evenly across all partitions over time.
`You need to select a partition key.
`Which two partition keys can you use? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.

- [ ] a single property value that does not appear frequently in the documents
- [ ] a value containing the collection name
- [ ] a single property value that appears frequently in the documents
- [x] a concatenation of multiple property values with a random suffix appended
- [x] a hash suffix appended to a property value

#### 0020,a Q19p14.2 ::You develop an Azure solution that uses Cosmos DB.
`The current Cosmos DB container must be replicated and must use a partition key that is optimized for queries.
`You need to implement a change feed processor solution.
`Which change feed processor components should you use?
`
`Store the data from which the change feed is generated.
