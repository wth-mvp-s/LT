#### 3. Qp20.3Topic5Set5question25 [59%]::You are developing an Azure solution to collect point-of-sale (POS) device data from 2,000 stores located throughout the world. A single device can produce 2 megabytes (MB) of data every 24 hours. Each store location has one to five devices that send data.
`You must store the device data in Azure Blob storage. Device data must be correlated based on a device identifier. Additional stores are expected to open in the future.
`You need to implement a solution to receive the device data.
`Solution: Provision an Azure Event Hub. Configure the machine identifier as the partition key and enable capture.
`Does the solution meet the goal?

- [ ] Yes
- [x] No


#### 4.A 0021_todo ::You are developing an Azure solution to collect inventory data from thousands of stores located around the world. Each store location will send the inventory data hourly to an Azure Blob storage account for processing.
The solution must meet the following requirements:
✑ Begin processing when data is saved to Azure Blob storage.
✑ Filter data based on store location information.
✑ Trigger an Azure Logic App to process the data for output to Azure Cosmos DB.
✑ Enable high availability and geographic distribution.
✑ Allow 24-hours for retries.
✑ Implement an exponential back off data processing.
You need to configure the solution.
