#### Qp34.3Topic5Set5question25 [59%]::You are developing an Azure solution to collect point-of-sale (POS) device data from 2,000 stores located throughout the world. A single device can produce 2 megabytes (MB) of data every 24 hours. Each store location has one to five devices that send data.
`You must store the device data in Azure Blob storage. Device data must be correlated based on a device identifier. Additional stores are expected to open in the future.
`You need to implement a solution to receive the device data.
`Solution: Provision an Azure Event Hub. Configure the machine identifier as the partition key and enable capture.
`Does the solution meet the goal?

#### Qp28.Topic5.Set5.question1.A ::You have an application that provides weather forecasting data to external partners. You use Azure API Management to publish APIs.
`You must change the behavior of the API to meet the following requirements:
`✑ Support alternative input parameters
`✑ Remove formatting text from responses
`✑ Provide additional context to back-end services
`Which types of policies should you implement? To answer, drag the policy types to the correct scenarios. Each policy type may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
`
`Rewrite the request URL to match to the format expected by the web service.
