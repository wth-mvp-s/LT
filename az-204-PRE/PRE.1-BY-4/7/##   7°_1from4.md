#### 0025::
`You are developing an ASP.NET Core time sheet application that runs as an Azure Web App. Users of the application enter their time sheet information on the first day of every month.
`The application uses a third-party web service to validate data.
`The application encounters periodic server errors due to errors that result from calling a third-party web server. Each request to the third-party server has the same chance of failure.
`You need to configure an Azure Monitor alert to detect server errors unrelated to the third-party service. You must minimize false-positive alerts.
`How should you complete the Azure Resource Manager template?
