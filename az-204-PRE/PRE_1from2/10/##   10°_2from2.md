`Retail store locations -
`Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries.
`
`Delivery services -
`Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates.
`Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.

`
`Inventory services -
`The company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.
`
`Issues -
`
`Retail Store Locations -
`You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data.
`Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.
`
`Question
