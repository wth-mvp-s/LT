#### Q9.18::
`Issues -
`
`Function app -
`You perform local testing for the RequestUserApproval function. The following error message displays:
`'Timeout value of 00:10:00 exceeded by function: RequestUserApproval'
`The same error message displays when you test the function in an Azure development environment when you run the following Kusto query:
`
`FunctionAppLogs -
`| where FunctionName = = "RequestUserApproval"
`
`Question
`
`You need to investigate the Azure Function app error message in the development environment.
`What should you do?

- [x] Connect Live Metrics Stream from Application Insights to the Azure Function app and filter the metrics.
- [ ] Create a new Azure Log Analytics workspace and instrument the Azure Function app with Application Insights.

`
`FunctionAppLogs -
`| where FunctionName = = "RequestUserApproval"
`
`Logic app -
`You test the Logic app in a development environment. The following error message displays:
`'400 Bad Request'
`Troubleshooting of the error shows an HttpTrigger action to call the RequestUserApproval function.
`
`Question
`
`You need to correct the RequestUserApproval Function app error.
`What should you do?

- [ ] Update line RA13 to use the async keyword and return an HttpRequest object value.
- [ ] Configure the Function app to use an App Service hosting plan. Enable the Always On setting of the hosting plan.
- [x] Update the function to be stateful by using Durable Functions to process the request payload.
- [ ] Update the functionTimeout property of the host.json project file to 15 minutes.
