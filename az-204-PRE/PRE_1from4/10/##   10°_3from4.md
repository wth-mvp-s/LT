`What should you do first?

- [ ] Write custom code to make a Microsoft Graph API call from the e-commerce web app.
- [ ] Assign the Contributor RBAC role to the e-commerce web app by using the Resource Manager create role assignment API.

#### 13 ::
`Retail store locations -
`Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries.
`
`Delivery services -
`Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates.
`Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.
`
`Question
`
`You need to implement the retail store location Azure Function.
`How should you configure the solution?
`Configuration - Value

- [ ] Binding : Blob storage
- [x] Binding : Azure Cosmos DB
- [ ] Binding : Event Grid
- [ ] Binding : HTTP
- [ ] Binding Direction : Input
- [x] Binding Direction : Output
- [x] Trigger : Blob storage
- [ ] Trigger : Azure Cosmos DB
- [ ] Trigger : Event Grid
- [ ] Trigger : HTTP


#### 14 ::
`Requirements -
`
`Corporate website -
`Minimize costs for data storage and hosting.
`Implement native GitHub workflows for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
`Distribute the website content globally for local use.
`Implement monitoring by using Application Insights and availability web tests including SSL certificate validity and custom header value verification.
`The website must have 99.95 percent uptime.
`
`Retail store locations -
`Azure Functions must process data immediately when data is uploaded to Blob storage. Azure Functions must update Azure Cosmos DB by using native SQL language queries.
`Audit store sale transaction information nightly to validate data, process sales financials, and reconcile inventory.
`
`Delivery services -
`Store service telemetry data in Azure Cosmos DB by using an Azure Function. Data must include an item id, the delivery vehicle license plate, vehicle package capacity, and current vehicle location coordinates.
`Store delivery driver profile information in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) by using an Azure Function called from the corporate website.
`
`Inventory services -
`The company has contracted a third-party to develop an API for inventory processing that requires access to a specific blob within the retail store storage account for three months to include read-only access to the data.
`
`Issues -
`
`Retail Store Locations -
`You must perform a point-in-time restoration of the retail store location data due to an unexpected and accidental deletion of data.
`Azure Cosmos DB queries from the Azure Function exhibit high Request Unit (RU) usage and contain multiple, complex queries that exhibit high point read latency for large items as the function app is scaling.
`
