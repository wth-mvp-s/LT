#### 0031_new c [2?]::You are building a web application that performs image analysis on user photos and returns metadata containing objects identified. 
`The image analysis is very costly in terms of time and compute resources. 
`You are planning to use Azure Redis Cache so duplicate uploads do not need to be reprocessed.
`In case of an Azure data center outage, metadata loss must be kept to a minimum.
`You need to configure the Azure Redis cache instance.
`Which two actions should you perform? 

- [ ] Configure Azure Redis with AOF persistence.

- [ ] Configure second storage account for persistence.
- [x] Set backup frequency to the minimum value.


#### 0032_new c [????]::You are developing an Azure-based web application. 
`The application goes offline periodically to perform offline data processing. While the application is offline, numerous Azure Monitor alerts fire which result in the on-call developer being paged.
`The application must always log when the application is offline for any reason.
`You need to ensure that the on-call developer is not paged during offline processing.
`What should you do?

- [ ] Add Azure Monitor alert processing rules to suppress notifications.
- [ ] Disable Azure Monitor Service Health Alerts during offline processing.
- [ ] Create an Azure Monitor Metric Alert.
- [x] Build an Azure Monitor action group that suppresses the alerts.



#### Qp29.new_p.39 [most-voted]::You are developing an Azure solution to collect point-of-sale (POS) device data from 2,000 stores located throughout the world. A single device can produce 2 megabytes (MB) of data every 24 hours. Each store location has one to five devices that send data.
`You must store the device data in Azure Blob storage. Device data must be correlated based on a device identifier. Additional stores are expected to open in the future.
