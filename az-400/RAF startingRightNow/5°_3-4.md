- [x] a personal access token (PAT)
- [ ] a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token
- [ ] NTLM authentication



#### 00226::
`You need to recommend an integration strategy for the build process of a Java application. The solution must meet the following requirements:

#### 00230 ::
`Your company uses a Git repository in Azure Repos to manage the source code of a web application. The master branch is protected from direct updates.
`Developers work on new features in the topic branches.
`Because of the high volume of requested features, it is difficult to follow the history of the changes to the master branch.
`You need to enforce a pull request merge strategy. The strategy must meet the following requirements:
`✑ Consolidate commit histories.
`✑ Merge the changes into a single commit.
`Which merge strategy should you use in the branch policy?

- [x] squash merge
- [ ] fast-forward merge
- [ ] Git fetch
- [ ] no-fast-forward merge

`You need to ensure that Jenkins can retrieve source code from Azure Repos.
`Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

- [ ] Create a webhook in Jenkins.
- [x] Add the Team Foundation Server (TFS) plug-in to Jenkins.
- [x] Add a personal access token to your Jenkins account.
- [x] Create a personal access token (PAT) in your Azure DevOps account.
- [ ] Create a service hook in Azure DevOps.


#### 00233::
