yarn - facebooks npm 
jenkins - building, testing, and deploying software

kubernates - orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
helm package - chart,  package manager for Kubernetes,  collection of Kubernetes resources that are packaged together for deployment.

retention -  time that data and artifacts are kept in a system or storage location. 
configure RBAC roles in the cluster
DACPAC - file type used in SQL Server for deployment and backup purpouse, create and update 
BACPAC - export and import 
a readiness probe - In Kubernetes, if container is ready to serve traffic.

RBAC binding - (Role-Based Access Control) binding refers to the process of associating a role with one or more users or groups in a system.

self hosted agent - jobs

artifacts feed - like github. 

KPI rate - track progress

cluster - many comp computing together

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deploy and maintien containers

RTW (Real-Time Web) Release -  data is transmitted continuously between the client and server, not like in classic backend communication request-response model
