`|Project 1|The project team provides preconfigured YAML files that it wants to use to manage future pipeline configuration changes.|

`|Project 2|The sensitivity of the project requires that the source code be hosted on the managed Windows server on your company's network.|

`|Project 3|The project team requires a centralized version control system to ensure that developers work with the most recent version.|
//


`|Project1|Project leads must be able to restrict access to individual files and folders in the repository.|

`|Project2|The version control system must enforce the following rules on the server before merging any changes to the main branch: - changes must be reviewed by at least two project members. - Changes must be associated by at least one work item|

`|Project3|The project members must be able to work in Azure Repos directly from Xcode.|

`|Project4|The release branch must only be viewable or editable by the project leads. |

`You plan to use Azure Repos for all the projects.
