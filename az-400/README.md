 2 tools for checking security, licenses in code before deployment. Not deployment tools, but help prepare.
 
     deployment gate -
        - pre post deployment validation
        - safety of deployment
        - on top of az realease pipeline
        - delays possible


    whiteSource Bolt, black Duck
        - security scan for vurnebilities
        - free in marketplace
        - delay 

    whitesource bolt - more seamlessly with Azure Pipeline, free
   
    black Duck - more advances integration with azure boards, paid, reporting and analytics more advanced  
    
    sonarQube  same but focuses on code quality, not security/licenses. Checks for bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities. Helps improve code before deployment.
    
    gradle in pipeline
        - tool, building and deploying Java apps
        - defined repository
        - faster
        - more flexible

    maven
        - simplify build, test, deploy java, XML
        - challenging to setup
        - central repository
        - slower, exec all code 
        - rigid structure 
        - been for longer

    selenium
        - testing cloud-based

    a readiness probe
        - health check
        - check if steady 

    flaky marker
        - tag for unstable result 

    liveness probe
        - is running test, action if not 

    readiness probe
        - container is ready for traffic check 

    SonarQube
        - quality code inspection

    KPI (Key Performance Indicators)
        - goals achiveness monitoring


yarn - facebooks npm 
jenkins - building, testing, and deploying software

kubernates - Docker is like a single Git repository with one project, while Kubernetes is like a Git organization that manages multiple repositories and projects.

helm package - chart,  package manager for Kubernetes,  collection of Kubernetes resources that are packaged together for deployment.

retention -  time that data and artifacts are kept in a system or storage location. 

RBAC roles in the cluster -  in Kubernetes cluster manages who can do what. Uses roles for users/groups to control permissions.

DACPAC - schema file for deploying schema changes or versioning dbb

BACPAC - export and import dbb

a readiness probe - In Kubernetes, if container is ready to serve traffic.
a liviness probe - In Kubernetes, if container is still running and able to perform its intended function.
     WhiteSource 
     
     

RBAC binding - (Role-Based Access Control) binding refers to the process of associating a role with one or more users or groups in a system.

self hosted agent - jobs

artifacts feed - like github. 

KPI rate - track progress
KPI -  are measurable values, not a tool. 
cluster - many comp computing together

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) deploy and maintien containers

RTW (Real-Time Web) Release -  data is transmitted continuously between the client and server, not like in classic backend communication request-response model

ad-hoc queries against the monitoring data

runbook to Azure Automation.
