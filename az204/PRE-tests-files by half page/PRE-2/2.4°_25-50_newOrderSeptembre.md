#### 00, Q20 ::You are developing an application that uses Azure Blob storage.
`The application must read the transaction logs of all the changes that occur to the blobs and the blob metadata in the storage account for auditing purposes. The changes must be in the order in which they occurred, include only create, update, delete, and copy operations and be retained for compliance reasons.
`You need to process the transaction logs asynchronously.
`What should you do?

- [ ] Process all Azure Blob storage events by using Azure Event Grid with a subscriber Azure Function app.
- [x] Enable the change feed on the storage account and process all changes for available events.
- [ ] Process all Azure Storage Analytics logs for successful blob events.
- [ ] Use the Azure Monitor HTTP Data Collector API and scan the request body for successful blob events.

#### Q22 ::You are developing an Azure Function App that processes images that are uploaded to an Azure Blob container.
`Images must be processed as quickly as possible after they are uploaded, and the solution must minimize latency. You create code to process images when the
`Function App is triggered.
`You need to configure the Function App.
`What should you do?

- [ ] Use an App Service plan. Configure the Function App to use an Azure Blob Storage input trigger.
- [ ] Use a Consumption plan. Configure the Function App to use an Azure Blob Storage trigger.
- [ ] Use a Consumption plan. Configure the Function App to use a Timer trigger.
- [x] Use an App Service plan. Configure the Function App to use an Azure Blob Storage trigger.
- [ ] Use a Consumption plan. Configure the Function App to use an Azure Blob Storage input trigger.

#### Q25 ::You are developing a solution for a hospital to support the following use cases:
`✑ The most recent patient status details must be retrieved even if multiple users in different locations have updated the patient record.
`✑ Patient health monitoring data retrieved must be the current version or the prior version.
`✑ After a patient is discharged and all charges have been assessed, the patient billing record contains the final charges.
`You provision a Cosmos DB NoSQL database and set the default consistency level for the database account to Strong. You set the value for Indexing Mode to
Consistent.
`You need to minimize latency and any impact to the availability of the solution. You must override the default consistency level at the query level to meet the required consistency guarantees for the scenarios.
`Which consistency levels should you implement? To answer, drag the appropriate consistency levels to the correct requirements. Each consistency level may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
`
`Return the most recent patient status.

- [x] Strong
- [ ] Bounded Staleness
- [ ] Consistent Prefix
- [ ] Eventual

#### Q26 ::The development environment requires several software development kits (SDKs) and third-party components to support application development across the organization. You install and customize the deployed virtual machine (VM) for your development team. The customized VM must be saved to allow provisioning of a new team member development environment.
`You need to save the customized VM for future provisioning.
`Which tools or services should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
`
`Generalize the VM.

- [x] Azure PowerShell
- [ ] Visual Studio command prompt
- [ ] Azure Migrate
- [ ] Azure Backup

#### Q27 ::You are preparing to deploy a website to an Azure Web App from a GitHub repository. The website includes static content generated by a script.
`You plan to use the Azure Web App continuous deployment feature.
`You need to run the static generation script before the website starts serving traffic.
What are two possible ways to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.


- [ ] Add the path to the static content generation tool to WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE setting in the host.json file.
- [x] Add a PreBuild target in the websites csproj project file that runs the static content generation script.
- [ ] Create a file named run.cmd in the folder /run that calls a script which generates the static content and deploys the website.
- [x] Create a file named .deployment in the root of the repository that calls a script which generates the static content and deploys the website.
