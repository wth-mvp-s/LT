`Which type of cache purge should you use?

- [x] single path
- [ ] wildcard
- [ ] root domain



#### Qp21.26 ::Your company is developing an Azure API.
`You need to implement authentication for the Azure API. You have the following requirements:
`All API calls must be secure.
`

`✑ Use OpenID Connect for authentication
`✑ Prevent anonymous usage
`A recent security audit found that several web services can be called without any authentication.
`Which API Management policy should you implement?

- [ ] jsonp
- [ ] authentication-certificate
- [ ] check-header
- [x] validate-jwt



#### Qp22.28 ::Contoso, Ltd. provides an API to customers by using Azure API Management (APIM). The API authorizes users with a JWT token.
`You must implement response caching for the APIM gateway. The caching mechanism must detect the user ID of the client that accesses data for a given location and cache the response for that user ID.
`You need to add the following policies to the policies file:
`✑ a set-variable policy to store the detected user identity
`✑ a cache-lookup-value policy
`✑ a cache-store-value policy
`✑ a find-and-replace policy to update the response body with the user profile information
`To which policy section should you add the policies? To answer, drag the appropriate sections to the correct policies. Each section may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
`
`Set-variable

- [x] Inbound
- [ ] Outbond

#### Qp22.30 ::You are developing an Azure App Service REST API.
`The API must be called by an Azure App Service web app. The API must retrieve and update user profile information stored in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).
