#### Q25.2 ::You are developing a solution for a hospital to support the following use cases:
`✑ The most recent patient status details must be retrieved even if multiple users in different locations have updated the patient record.
`✑ Patient health monitoring data retrieved must be the current version or the prior version.
`✑ After a patient is discharged and all charges have been assessed, the patient billing record contains the final charges.
`You provision a Cosmos DB NoSQL database and set the default consistency level for the database account to Strong. You set the value for Indexing Mode to
Consistent.
`You need to minimize latency and any impact to the availability of the solution. You must override the default consistency level at the query level to meet the required consistency guarantees for the scenarios.
`Which consistency levels should you implement? To answer, drag the appropriate consistency levels to the correct requirements. Each consistency level may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.
`
`Return health monitoring data that is no less than one version behind

- [ ] Strong
- [x] Bounded Staleness
- [ ] Consistent Prefix

#### Q27 ::You are preparing to deploy a website to an Azure Web App from a GitHub repository. The website includes static content generated by a script.
`You plan to use the Azure Web App continuous deployment feature.
`You need to run the static generation script before the website starts serving traffic.
What are two possible ways to achieve this goal? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.


- [ ] Add the path to the static content generation tool to WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE setting in the host.json file.
- [x] Add a PreBuild target in the websites csproj project file that runs the static content generation script.
- [ ] Create a file named run.cmd in the folder /run that calls a script which generates the static content and deploys the website.
- [x] Create a file named .deployment in the root of the repository that calls a script which generates the static content and deploys the website.
