`You need to provide access to storage2. The solution must meet the PaaS networking requirements and the business requirements.
`Which connectivity method should you use?
`::
`
`Azure Service Endpoint provides secure and direct connectivity to Azure 
`PaaS services over an optimized route over the Azure backbone network.
`Traffic still left your VNet and hit the public endpoint of PaaS service. ==> Then it can't meet the goal because of the public IP
`
`Azure Private Link (or Private Endpoint) allows you to access Azure PaaS services over Private IP address within the VNet. It's then OK
`
`A is the answer PRIVATE ENDPOINT


- [x] a private endpoint 
- [ ] Azure Firewall
- [ ] Azure Front Door
- [ ] a service endpoint

`Question
`You need to prepare Vnet1 for the deployment of an ExpressRoute gateway. The solution must meet the hybrid connectivity requirements and the business requirements.
`Which three actions should you perform in sequence for Vnet1? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer.
`Select and Place:
`::
`1. Delete VPN GW1.
`2. Set the subnet mask of Gateway Subnet to /27.
`3. Create a VPN gateway by using the VPN GW1 SKU.
`
`Basic VPN Gateway does not support P2S.
`If the gateway subnet is /29, you've to first delete the virtual network gateway and increase the gateway subnet size.

- [0] Delete VPN GW1.
- [1] Set the subnet mask of Gateway Subnet to /27.

`
`Question
`For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
`NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
`::
`
`No:
`Zone 2 is not linked to any VNETs therefor no VMs can resolve names in Zone 2.

`
`PaaS Networking Requirements -
`Litware identifies the following networking requirements for platform as a service (PaaS):
`The storage1 account must be accessible from all on-premises locations without exposing the public endpoint of storage1.
`The storage2 account must be accessible from Vnet2 and Vnet3 without exposing the public endpoint of storage2.
`Question
`
`You need to configure the default route on Vnet2 and Vnet3. The solution must meet the virtual networking requirements.
`What should you use to configure the default route?

`Requirements -
`
`Business Requirements -
`Litware wants to minimize costs whenever possible, as long as all other requirements are met.
`
`Virtual Networking Requirements -
`Litware identifies the following virtual networking requirements:
`Direct the default route of 0.0.0.0/0 on Vnet2 and Vnet3 to the Boston datacenter over an ExpressRoute circuit.
`Ensure that the records in the cloud.litwareinc.com can be resolved from the on-premises locations.
`Automatically register the DNS names of Azure virtual machines to the cloud.litwareinc.com zone.
`Minimize the size of the subnets allocated to platform-managed services.
`Allow traffic from VMScaleSet1 to VMScaleSet2 on the TCP port 443 only.
`
`Hybrid Networking Requirements -
`Litware identifies the following hybrid networking requirements:
`Users must be able to connect to Vnet1 by using a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN when working remotely. Connections must be authenticated by Azure AD.
`Latency of the traffic between the Boston datacenter and all the virtual networks must be minimized.
`The Boston datacenter must connect to the Azure virtual networks by using an ExpressRoute FastPath connection.
`Traffic between Vnet2 and Vnet3 must be routed through Vnet1.
`
`PaaS Networking Requirements -
`Litware identifies the following networking requirements for platform as a service (PaaS):
`The storage1 account must be accessible from all on-premises locations without exposing the public endpoint of storage1.
`The storage2 account must be accessible from Vnet2 and Vnet3 without exposing the public endpoint of storage2.
`Question
`
`You need to implement outbound connectivity for VMScaleSet1. The solution must meet the virtual networking requirements and the business requirements.
`Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.
`::
`HTTPS health probe and Outbound Rules are ONLY supported on STD LB
`
`Create a Standard Load Balancer:
`Specify the load balancer's name, SKU (Standard), and public frontend IP configuration.
`Configure the HTTPS protocol for the frontend IP configuration.
`Set up the SSL certificate if required.
`Create a Backend Pool:
`Create a backend pool that includes the virtual machines in VMScaleSet1.
`Associate the backend pool with the frontend IP configuration of the load balancer.
`Configure Health Probe:
`Create a health probe with the required settings, such as the port (443) and probe interval.
`Associate the health probe with the backend pool.
`Create Outbound Rule:
`Define an outbound rule for the load balancer.
`Specify the backend pool and health probe to use for outbound traffic.
`
`Create a public load balancer in the Standard SKU:
`Think of this like buying a new gaming console. It's the main device you need. The "Standard SKU" means you're getting the version that has all the necessary features, not just the basic one.
`Create a backend pool that contains VMScaleSet1:
`Imagine gathering all your favorite games to play on this console. The backend pool is like a collection of games (here, it's the virtual machines in VMScaleSet1) that the console can run.
`Create an outbound rule:
`Set up the rules for who can play and when. Just like setting parental controls on your gaming console, creating an outbound rule controls how the virtual machines can connect to the outside world, ensuring they communicate securely and efficiently.

- [0] Create a public load balancer in the Standard SKU
- [1] Create a backend pool that contains VMScaleSet1
- [2] Create an outbound rule
- [ ] Create a health probe
- [ ] Create a public load balancer in the Basic SKU
- [ ] Create a NAT rule

`
`The NSGs are associated to the network interfaces on the virtual machines. Each NSG has one custom security rule that allows RDP connections from the internet. The firewall on each virtual machine allows ICMP traffic.
`An application security group named ASG1 is associated to the network interface of VM1.

`
`Requirements -
`
`Virtual Network Requirements -
`Contoso has the following virtual network requirements:
`Create a virtual network named Vnet6 in West US that will contain the following resources and configurations:
`- Two container groups that connect to Vnet6
`- Three virtual machines that connect to Vnet6
`- Allow VPN connections to be established to Vnet6
`- Allow the resources in Vnet6 to access KeyVault1, DB1, and Vnet1 over the Microsoft backbone network.
`The virtual machines in Vnet4 and Vnet5 must be able to communicate over the Microsoft backbone network.
`A virtual machine named VM-Analyze will be deployed to Subnet1. VM-Analyze must inspect the outbound network traffic from Subnet2 to the internet.
`
`Network Security Requirements -
`Contoso has the following network security requirements:
`Configure Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication for Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN users.
`Enable NSG flow logs for NSG3 and NSG4.
`Create an NSG named NSG10 that will be associated to Vnet1/Subnet1 and will have the custom inbound security rules shown in the following table.
``|Priority---|Port--|Protocol|Source-------|Destination----|Action|
``|500--------|3389--|TCP-----|10.1.0.0/16--|Any------------|Deny---|
``|1000-------|Any---|ICMP----|10.10.0.0/16-|VirtualNetwork-|Deny---|
`
`
`Create an NSG named NSG11 that will be associated to Vnet1/Subnet2 and will have the custom outbound security rules shown in the following table.
`
``|Priority---|Port--|Protocol|Source--------|Destination------|Action|
``|200--------|3389--|TCP-----|10.1.0.0/16---|VirtualNetwork---|Deny---|
`
`Question
`In which NSGs can you use ASG1 and to which virtual machine network interfaces can you associate ASG1? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
`NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
`::
`For clarification, ASG1's usage across different VNets would depend on the configurations that aren't detailed in the given case study. Therefore, the safest interpretation, based on the directly connected environment to Vnet1, would be:
`
`NSG1 and NSG2, which are directly within Vnet1 where ASG1 has a defined role, are the applicable NSGs for ASG1.
`VM2 would be the primary candidate for VM association since it is also within Vnet1.
