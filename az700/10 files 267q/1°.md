`You plan to configure BGP for a Site-to-Site VPN connection between a datacenter and Azure.
`Which two Azure resources should you configure? Each correct answer presents a part of the solution. (Choose two.)::
`Explanation: For BGP over a Site-to-Site VPN, 
`you need a virtual network gateway in Azure connected to your VNet 
`and a local network gateway that represents your on-premises VPN device.
`::
`so virtual network gateway (is on azure side) is like a teleport , by whom you may connect to the datacenter on premise, 
`and 
`local network gataway , is like other side portal, ( on datacenter side) for the teleportation ...

::
`The Story: "The Secure Gateway Festival"
`
`Imagine you're organizing a big festival (AppGwy1) in your town (contoso.com). The goal of the festival is to ensure that only residents of the town (domain-joined computers) can enter and enjoy the festivities, and you want to make sure that everyone is who they say they are (mutual authentication).
`
`Preparing the Entry Gate (Creating an SSL profile)
`Before you can start checking tickets, you need to set up a secure entry gate. This gate is specialâit checks both the tickets of the visitors and confirms the identity of the security staff (SSL profile). This is your first step because without a secure gate, you can't verify everyone properly.
`Issuing Secure Tickets (Uploading a certificate)
`Now that the gate is ready, you need tickets that are secure and hard to fake. You decide to issue special electronic tickets (certificate) that can be verified at the entry gate. You take a certificate from the town hall (on-premises computer) and make sure it can be read by the gate's scanners by uploading it to the festival's control system (AppGwy1).
`Setting Up the Scanners (Adding an HTTP listener and associating it to the SSL profile)
`With the secure gate and tickets ready, you need to set up the scanners (HTTP listener) that will read the tickets as the guests arrive. These scanners are connected to the gate's security system (associate the listener to the SSL profile) to ensure that every ticket is checked against the secure list.
`Organizing the Festival Paths (Creating a routing rule)
`Finally, once visitors are inside, you need to guide them to various parts of the festival (routing rule). This way, everyone knows where to go to enjoy the festival, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic and a better experience for everyone.

- [0] From AppGwyl, create an SSL profile. 
- [1] From an on-premises computer, upload a certificate to AppGwy1 
- [2] From AppGwyl, add an HTTP listener and associate the listener to the SSL profile. 
- [3] From AppGwy1, create a routing rule. 
- [ ] From AppGwy1, Create a frontend IP configuration.

`
`You need to connect the datacenter to VNet1 by using ExpressRoute. The solution must meet the following requirements:
`
`â¢ Maintain connectivity to the virtual machines if two availability zones fail.
`â¢ Support 1000-Mbps connections.

`::
`
`When deploying an ErGw1AZ, it is possible to define its zone availability as "Zone-Redundant", in addition it is also essential that the ip used by the ER Gateway be "Standard", because at the time of provisioning this ip will become redundant between the availability zones . Regarding the ER Circuit, it can be "Local", but in this scenario it would be unlimited and more expensive than the "Standard" Limited in 1Gbps. In my opinion the best answer would be:

1. One ExpressRoute Standard circuit
2. One ExpressRoute gateway of the ErGw1AZ SKU

`Requirements -
`
`
`Business Requirements -
`
`Litware wants to minimize costs whenever possible, as long as all other requirements are met.
`
`
`Virtual Networking Requirements -
`
`Litware identifies the following virtual networking requirements:
`
`â¢ Direct the default route of 0.0.0.0/0 on Vnet2 and Vnet3 to the Boston datacenter over an ExpressRoute circuit.
`â¢ Ensure that the records in the cloud.litwareinc.com can be resolved from the on-premises locations.
`â¢ Automatically register the DNS names of Azure virtual machines to the cloud.litwareinc.com zone.
`â¢ Minimize the size of the subnets allocated to platform-managed services.
`â¢ Allow traffic from VMScaleSet1 to VMScaleSet2 on the TCP port 443 only.
`
`
`Hybrid Networking Requirements -
`
`Litware identifies the following hybrid networking requirements:
`
`â¢ Users must be able to connect to Vnet1 by using a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN when working remotely. Connections must be authenticated by Azure AD.
`â¢ Latency of the traffic between the Boston datacenter and all the virtual networks must be minimized.
`â¢ The Boston datacenter must connect to the Azure virtual networks by using an ExpressRoute FastPath connection.
`â¢ Traffic between Vnet2 and Vnet3 must be routed through Vnet1.
`
`
`PaaS Networking Requirements -
`
`Litware identifies the following networking requirements for platform as a service (PaaS):
`
`â¢ The storage1 account must be accessible from all on-premises locations without exposing the public endpoint of storage1.
`â¢ The storage2 account must be accessible from Vnet2 and Vnet3 without exposing the public endpoint of storage2.
`
`
`You need to connect Vnet2 and Vnet3. The solution must meet the virtual networking requirements and the business requirements.
`
`Which two actions should you include in the solution? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
`
`NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- [x] On the peering from Vnet1, select Allow gateway transit. 
- [x] On the peerings from Vnet2 and Vnet3, select Use remote gateways. 
- [ ] On the peerings from Vnet2 and Vnet3, select Allow gateway transit.
- [ ] On the peering from Vnet1, select Use remote gateways.
- [ ] On the peering from Vnet1, select Allow forwarded traffic.

#### 027::
`You have an Azure subscription.
`
`You plan to use Azure Virtual WAN.
`
`You need to deploy a virtual WAN hub that meets the following requirements:
`
`â¢ Supports 4 Gbps of Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN traffic
`â¢ Supports 8 Gbps of ExpressRoute traffic
`â¢ Minimizes costs
