`You need to publish App1 by using AG1 and a URL of https://app1.contoso.com. The solution must meet the following requirements:
`• TLS connections must terminate on AG1.

`You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named Vnet1. Vnet1 has a /24 IPv4 address space.
`You need to subdivide Vnet1. The solution must maximize the number of usable subnets.
`What is the maximum number of IPv4 subnets you can create, and how many usable IP addresses will be available per subnet? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
`NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point::
::
`Correct.
`Using a /24 will give us 256 IPs. Now, In azure we can create a minimum subnet of /29 which gives us 8 IPs per subnet. Dividing 256/8 we get 32 thus we can have 32 IPv4 subnets. Out of each these subnets 5 IP from them will be used by azure so number of usable IP in each subnet is 3.

` Lazylinux Highly Voted  9 months ago
`Yes Answer is correct it is 3 IPs and 32 Subnets as smallest subnet in Azure is /29 dues to 5 reserved IPs out of any subnet and largest is /2 - example here from MS
`Are there any restrictions on using IP addresses within these subnets?
`Yes. Azure reserves the first four and last IP address for a total of 5 IP addresses within each subnet.
`For example, the IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24 has the following reserved addresses:
192.168.1.0 : Network address
192.168.1.1 : Reserved by Azure for the default `gateway
`192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3 : Reserved by Azure to map the Azure DNS IPs to the VNet space
`192.168.1.255 : Network broadcast address.

``|VM5---|West-US----|Vnet4/SubnetA-------|NSG5-------------------|
`
`
`The NSGs are associated to the network interfaces on the virtual machines. Each NSG has one custom security rule that allows RDP connections from the internet. The firewall on each virtual machine allows ICMP traffic.
`An application security group named ASG1 is associated to the network interface of VM1.
