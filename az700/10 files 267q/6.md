`You have 10 Azure App Service instances. Each instance hosts the same web app. Each instance is in a different Azure region.
`You need to configure Azure Traffic Manager to direct users to the instance that has the lowest latency.
`Which routing method should you use? ::
`Explanation: The performance routing method in Azure Traffic Manager routes user requests to the Azure region that has the lowest latency relative to the user's location.

- [ ] geographic
- [ ] weighted

- [x] performance


#### 002::
`Your company has offices in London, Tokyo, and New York.
`The company has a web app named App1 that has the Azure Traffic Manager profile shown in the following table.
`
`
`Parameter--Value--Azure region
`DNS Name -- appl.trafficmanager.net -- Not applicable
`Endpoint -- app1-asia.azurewebsites.net -- East Asia
`Endpoint -- app1-na.azurewebsites.net -- East US
`Endpoint -- app1-na.azurewebsites.net -- UK South
`Routing method -- Geographic -- Not applicable
`
`In Asia, you plan to deploy an additional endpoint that will host an updated version of App1.
`You need to route 10 percent of the traffic from the Tokyo office to the new endpoint during testing.
`What should you configure in Traffic Manager? ::
`Explanation: By configuring one Traffic Manager profile with five endpoints, you can manage the distribution of traffic, including sending a portion to a new testing endpoint without needing additional profiles.
`::
`Initially, there are only 3 endpoints with 1 TM profile using Geographic routing-method. However, you need to deploy 10% of traffic to Tokyo which requires Weighted TM routing-method. 
`When you create a Child TM, it is considered as endpoint. 
`Therefore, 3 endpoints + 1 endpoint (child TM) is equal to 4 endpoints. 1 
`Parent TM Profile + 1 Child Profile is equal to 2 Profiles.
`
`B is the correct answer. 2 Profiles and 4 endpoints
- [ ] two profiles and five endpoints
- [x] two profiles and four endpoints
- [ ] three profiles and four endpoints
- [ ] one profile and five endpoints

`You need to ensure that if port 8080 is unavailable on a backend server, all the traffic for https://www.contoso.com is redirected to the other backend server.
`What should you do? ::
`Explanation: Creating a health probe allows the application gateway to monitor the availability of port 8080 on the backend servers and redirect traffic if a server becomes unavailable.

`NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
`::
`3 Backend Pools | 3 Rules
`
`I believe this is a Classic Front Door question. The first reference link provides an overview of classic routing. The questions shows we have a single frontend (contoso.azurefd.net) and there are three paths - /uk, /us, and /images.
`
`The second link shows the three paths would each be a separate rule.
`
`Regarding the number of backend pools, the question states, "...must be routed to [App1uk or App1us]" for the two App Services. The third link does not indicate there is a way to route traffic to a specific app service based on location. However, if we put each app service in its own backend pool, we can have the path rule route to the correct App Service everytime. 
`The Latency routing logic is fine for storage accounts, but not the App Services based on the question requirements.

`- The virtual machines and the load balancer must be accessible only from the virtual network.
`- Costs must be minimized.
`What should you include in the recommendation? ::
`Explanation: The Azure Standard Load Balancer supports IPv6 and provides internal load balancing capabilities, making it suitable for scenarios where both the virtual machines and the load balancer should be accessible only from within the virtual network, while also focusing on cost efficiency.

- [ ] Basic Azure Load Balancer
- [ ] Azure Application Gateway v1
- [x] Azure Standard Load Balancer
- [ ] Azure Application Gateway v2



#### 011::
`You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:
`- A virtual network named Vnet1
`- Two subnets named subnet1 and AzureFirewallSubnet
`- A public Azure Firewall named FW1
`- A route table named RT1 that is associated to Subnet1
`- A rule routing of 0.0.0.0/0 to FW1 in RT1
`After deploying 10 servers that run Windows Server to Subnet1, you discover that none of the virtual machines were activated.
`You need to ensure that the virtual machines can be activated.
`What should you do? ::
`Explanation: Configuring a DNAT rule for port 1688 on FW1 will redirect KMS activation traffic correctly through the firewall to allow the virtual machines on Subnet1 to reach the Azure Key Management Service (KMS) for activation.

- [ ] On FW1, configure a DNAT rule for port 1688.
- [ ] Deploy an application security group that allows outbound traffic to 1688.
- [x] Add an internet route to RT1 for the Azure Key Management Service (KMS).
- [ ] Deploy an Azure Standard Load Balancer that has an outbound NAT rule.

`You have an Azure subscription that contains the virtual networks shown in the following table.
`
`
`Name --- Subnet -------------- Peered with
`VNet1 -- Subnet11, Subnet12 -- VNet2
`VNet2 -- Subnet21 ------------ VNet1
`
`The subscription contains the virtual machines shown in the following table.
`
`
`Name -- Connected to -- Availability set
`VM1 --- Subnet11 ------ AS1
`VM2 --- Subnet11 ------ AS1
`VM3 --- Subnet12 ------ None
`VM4 --- Subnet21 ------ None
`
`You create a load balancer named LB1 that has the following configurations:
`
`‚Ä¢ SKU: Basic
`‚Ä¢ Type: Internal
`‚Ä¢ Subnet: Subnet12
`‚Ä¢ Virtual network: VNet1
`
`For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
`
`NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

`[EXAMTOPICS COMMENT]
`
`Basic LB needs vms to be in Available set or VM scale set and in same vnet where LB is deployed but STD LB can load balance single VMs by adding single vms to backend pool but they also MUST be In same vNET where the LB is deployed

- [x] LB1 can balance requests between VM1 and VM2. : Yes
- [ ] LB1 can balance requests between VM1 and VM2. : No
- [ ] LB1 can balance requests between VM2 and VM3. : Yes

`
`You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains an Azure application gateway that has the following configurations:
`
`‚Ä¢ Name: AppGW1
`‚Ä¢ Tier: Standard V2
`‚Ä¢ Autoscaling: Disabled
`
`You create an Azure AD user named User1.
`
`You need to ensure that User1 can change the tier of AppGW1. The solution must use the principle of least privilege.
`
`Which role should you assign to User1, and to which tiers can AppGW1 be changed? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
