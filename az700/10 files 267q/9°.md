You need to ensure that you can use the service endpoint to connect to the read-only endpoint of storage1 in the paired Azure region.
What should you do first?
A. Fail over storage1 to the paired Azure region.
B. Configure the firewall settings for storage1.
C. Create a virtual network in the paired Azure region.
D. Create another service endpoint.



 


You have the Azure App Service app shown in the App Service exhibit.

The VNet Integration settings for as12 are configured as shown in the Vnet Integration exhibit.

The Private Endpoint connections settings for as12 are configured as shown in the Private Endpoint connections exhibit.

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:

You have an Azure virtual network named Vnet1 that connects to an on-premises network.
You have an Azure Storage account named storageaccount1 that contains blob storage.
You need to configure a private endpoint for the blob storage. The solution must meet the following requirements:
✑ Ensure that all on-premises users can access storageaccount1 through the private endpoint.
✑ Prevent access to storageaccount1 from being interrupted.
Which four actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

`You have an Azure virtual network named VNet1 that contains the subnets shown in the following table.

Name -- Is a gateway subnet -- Description
Subnet1 -------- No ---------- Has connected virtual machines 
Subnet2 -------- No ---------- Has no connected resources
GatewaySubnet -- Yes --------- None

`You need to deploy an Azure application gateway named AppGW1 to VNet1.
`To where can you deploy AppGW1?

- [x] GatewaySubnet only
- [ ] Subnet2 only
- [ ] Subnet1 or Subnet2 only
- [ ] Subnet2 or GatewaySubnet only
- [ ] Subnet1, Subnet2, and GatewaySubnet


#### 002::
`You have an Azure subscription that contains multiple virtual machine scale sets and multiple Azure load balancers. The load balancers balance traffic across the scale sets.
`You plan to deploy Azure Front Door to load balance traffic across the load balancers.
`You need to identify which Front Door SKU to configure, and what to use to route the traffic to the load balancers. The solution must minimize costs.
`What should you identify? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
`NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- [ ] SKU: Classic
- [x] SKU: Premium
- [ ] SKU: Standard
- [x] Use: Azure Private Link 
- [ ] Use: Azure Route Server 
- [ ] Use: A service endpoint



#### 005::
`You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:
`
`• A virtual network named Vnet1
`• Two subnets named subnet1 and AzureFirewallSubnet
`• A public Azure Firewall named FW1
`• A route table named RT1 that is associated to Subnet1
`• A rule routing of 0.0.0.0/0 to FW1 in RT1
`
`After deploying 10 servers that run Windows Server to Subnet1, you discover that none of the virtual machines were activated.
`
`You need to ensure that the virtual machines can be activated.
``What should you do?

- [ ] A. Deploy a NAT gateway.
- [ ] B. Deploy an Azure Standard Load Balancer that has an outbound NAT rule.
- [ ] C. On FW1, create an outbound network rule that allows traffic to the Azure Key Management Service (KMS).
- [x] D. To Subnet1, associate a network security group (NSG) that allows outbound access to port 1688.

`You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table.
`
`Name --------- Туре ------------------------------- Description
`App1 --------- Azure App Service app -------------- Accessed by using a URL of https://app1.contoso.com/
`FD1 ---------- Azure Front Door Premium profile --- Configured as an endpoint for App1 
`contoso.com -- Azure DNS zone --------------------- Contains a DNS CNAME record for App1 
`----------------------------------------------------that resolves to an FQDN of app1.azurewebsites.net
`
`You discover that users connect directly to App1.
`
`You need to meet the following requirements:
`
`• Administrators must only access App1 by using a private endpoint.
`• All user connections to App1 must be routed through FD1.
`• The downtime of connections to App1 must be minimized.
``Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.


- [0] In the settings of App1, create a private endpoint.
- [1] In the settings of App1, approve a pending private endpoint connection.
- [2] Change the DNS record of app1.contoso.com to resolve to the FQDN of FD1.
- [ ] For fd1.contoso.com, create a DNS A record that resolves to the IP address of the private endpoint.
- [ ] In the settings of FD1, configure the origin group to enable the Azure Private Link service.
- [ ] For app1.contoso.com, create a DNS A record that resolves to the IP address of the private endpoint.




#### 003::
`Your on-premises network contains a DNS server named Server1.
`You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table.
`
`Name ------ Туре ------------- Description
`VNet1 ----- Virtual network -- None
`VM1 ------- Virtual machine -- Connected to VNet1
`-------------------------------Connected to storage1 by using a
`-------------------------------private endpoint
`storage1 -- Storage account -- None
`The on-premises network is connected to VNet1 by using a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN.
`You need to ensure that Server1 can resolve the DNS name of storage1. The solution must minimize costs and administrative effort.
`What should you use?

- [ ] A. Azure DNS Private Resolver
- [ ] B. an Azure public DNS zone
- [x] C. an Azure Private DNS zone
- [ ] D. an Azure virtual machine that hosts a DNS service



#### 002::
`You have an Azure Private Link service named PL1 that uses an Azure load balancer named LB1.
`You need to ensure that PL1 can support a higher volume of outbound traffic.
`What should you do?

- [ ] A. Increase the number of frontend IP configurations for LB1.
- [x] B. Increase the number of NAT IP addresses assigned to PL1.
- [ ] C. Deploy an Azure Application Gateway v2 instance to the source NAT subnet.
