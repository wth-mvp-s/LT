DRAG DROP
-

You have two on-premises datacenters.

You have an Azure subscription that contains four virtual networks named VNet1, VNet2, VNet3, and VNet4.

You create an Azure virtual WAN named VWAN1. VWAN1 contains a single virtual hub that is connected to both on-premises datacenters and all the virtual networks in a full mesh topology.

You create a route table named RT1.

You need to configure VWAN1 to meet the following requirements:

• Connectivity between VNet1 and VNet2 and both on-premises datacenters must be allowed.
• Connectivity between VNet3 and VNet4 and both on-premises datacenters must be allowed.
• VNet1 and VNet2 must be isolated from VNet3 and VNet4.

How should you configure routing for VNet1 and VNet2 and for both on-premises datacenters? To answer, drag the appropriate route tables and route table propagation to the correct requirements. Each route table and route table propagation may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content.

You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure key vault named Vault1 and an app registration for an Azure AD app named App1.

You have a DNS domain named contoso.com that is hosted by a third-party DNS provider.

You plan to deploy App1 by using Azure App Service. App1 will have the following configurations:

• App1 will be hosted across five App Service apps.
• Users will access App1 by using a URL of https://app1.contoso.com.
• The user traffic of App1 will be managed by using Azure Front Door.
• The traffic between Front Door and the App Service apps will be sent by using HTTP.
• App1 will be secured by using an SSL certificate from a third-party certificate authority (CA).

You need to support the Front Door deployment.
