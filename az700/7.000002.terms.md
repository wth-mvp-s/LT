TCP::HTTP relies on a reliable transport protocol to ensure messages are delivered in order and without loss, which .......... provides.::(Transmission Control Protocol)

12076::Microsoft reserves _____ for Azure public, Azure private, and Microsoft peering. 
65515::Microsoft reserves _____ for internal use. Virtual networks are created with the default ASN of _____.
OpenVPN ::______is the only protocol that can use Azure AD-based authentication.

S2S:: This type of VPN is designed to connect entire networks to each other, typically connecting an on-premises network to an Azure VNet or connecting two Azure VNets. It is not suitable for individual client connections because it expects a VPN device or gateway on each side of the connection, not a single client computer.::Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN

VNet Peering:: ______ is used to connect two Azure Virtual Networks seamlessly. It allows resources in either VNet to communicate with each other as if they were within the same network. However, it does not provide a way for a remote client to establish a VPN connection into an Azure VNet.

VNet-to-VNet :: Similar to S2S VPNs, ______ connections are designed to connect Azure VNets together, not for individual client connections. This method also relies on VPN gateways in each VNet.

Route Tables:: While _____ are important for controlling the flow of network traffic within Azure, including traffic that goes through a VPN gateway, they do not facilitate the actual connection process for a remote client. They are more about managing traffic once a connection is established.

Service Endpoints:: ______ provide secure and direct connectivity to Azure services over the Azure backbone network. However, they are used to secure Azure service resources to a VNet, not for facilitating remote client connections to VNets.

seamless::VNet peering is used to connect two Azure Virtual Networks ------- (how).



private endpoints::Unlike most services in Azure, _______ do not require a dedicated subnet 
26::Azure Firewall requires a /__ subnet allocated to it, 

BGP::Azure Route Server supports only the _____ protocol.

subnet::In Azure, you create a route table, and then associate the route table to zero or more ___. Each ______can have zero or one route tables associated to it.::virtual network subnets

NetApp Files::blocks anything else from being deployed to the subnet.

WAN::............ is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical area for the purpose of computer networking. _____s are used to connect smaller networks, such as local area networks (LANs) or metro area networks (MANs), enabling businesses, governments, and individuals to communicate and share data over long distances. Unlike LANs, which are typically restricted to a single building or site, _____s can span cities, regions, countries, or even continents.


10.0.0.0 172.16.0.0 192.168.0.0 ::three IP address ranges are designated for private use

500::Scale units for VPN are in ........... Mbps increments,





VNet-to-VNet Connection:: This is typically used for connecting VNets across different Azure regions or subscriptions and involves VPN gateways. It's more complex and costly for this scenario, where all VNets are in the same region and likely the same subscription.

Route Tables:: While ........... are necessary for custom routing decisions within and across VNets, they do not provide connectivity on their own. You'd still need a connectivity solution like peering or VPNs, which directly enables communication.

Service Endpoints:: .......... extend your VNet's identity to Azure services over the Azure backbone network. They're used for securing Azure service resources to your VNet and do not facilitate connectivity to on-premises networks.

NAT gateways::.......... are used to provide internet access to virtual machines in your Azure VNet that do not have public IP addresses. They allow these VMs to initiate outbound connections to the internet, translating their private IP addresses to a public address.

DNAT::.......... rule allows certain IPs (or all) to have a destination port/ IP. All other rule types are for outbound connectivity.

Front Door::has WAF capabilities, can do caching at the edge

subnet::Each ........... can have zero or one route tables associated to it.

P2S VPN connection::A .......... allows the administrator to manage the environment with minimum effort.

24::CIDR /........... is the minimum address space required to create a hub. 

Application Gateway::Front Door is used to load balance web app traffic globally. ........... is used to load balance web app traffic regionally.

Vnet peering ::..........enables communication between virtual networks within the same region or different regions.::Virtual network peering does not need a VPN connection to work, although it can be used as a backup in case of a failure. 


Traffic Manager::.......... is used for load balancing at the DNS level.
NAT Gateway ::.......... is used to simplify outbound connectivity to the internet.

Service endpoint policies::.......... can be enabled to restrict traffic to specific storage accounts. To restrict access to an individual storage account, ........... are restrictive.
Service tags::.......... allow access but for the region and all storage accounts in the region and not just to specific storage accounts. 

2::Determining Scale Units: Scale units determine the bandwidth capacity of your Virtual WAN hub. For supporting ExpressRoute with 8 Gbps, you will need to configure enough scale units to handle this capacity. Each scale unit for an Azure Virtual WAN Standard hub adds a certain amount of throughput capacity. Generally, 1 scale unit of a Standard hub supports up to ........... Gbps of ExpressRoute traffic.







500 ::...........Mbps/unit, For the S2S VPN Gateway:Each scale unit typically supports .......... Mbps for S2S VPN connections.

2::For ExpressRoute The HighPerformance SKU can support up to ......... Gbps per unit.


network address:: is the first address in the subnet and represents the ........... itself. It is used to identify the subnet.; Example: For the subnet 192.168.0.0/20, the network address is 192.168.0.0

Broadcast Address:: is the last address in the subnet and is used to send data to all devices within the subnet. When data is sent to the ..........., it is received by all devices on the subnet.; Example: For the subnet 192.168.0.0/20, the ........... address is 192.168.15.255

 P2S::Cross region vnet integration requires a vpn gateway and a ........... vpn connection

 Virtual Private Network::VPN
