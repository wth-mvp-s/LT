# 1st.1.21::You are preparing to connect your on-premises network to VNET4 by using a Site-to-Site VPN. The on-premises endpoint of the VPN will be created on a firewall named Firewall1.

The on-premises network has the following configuration:

• internal address range: 10.10.0.0/16
• Firewall1 internal IP address: 10.10.1.1
• Firewall public IP address: 131.107.50.60

BGP is NOT used.

You need to create the object that will provide the IP addressing configuration of the on-premises network to the Site-to-Site VPN. You do NOT need to create a virtual network gateway to complete this task.

# 1st.1.22::You need to ensure that hosts on VNET2 can access hosts on both VNET1 and VNET3. The solution must prevent hosts on VNET1 and VNET3 from communicating through VNET2.

# 2nd.1.36::You have two servers that are each hosted by a separate service provider in New York and California. The server hosted in New York is accessible by using a host name of ny.contoso.com. The server hosted in California is accessible by using a host name of ca.contoso.com.

You need to implement an Azure solution to route users to the server that has the lowest latency. The solution must minimize costs.


# 3nd.1/10.35::You need to ensure that all hosts deployed to subnet3-2 connect to the internet by using the same static public IP address. The solution must minimize administrative effort when adding hosts to the subnet.


# 3nd.2from10.36::You need to ensure that subnet 4-3 can accommodate 507 hosts.

# 3nd.3from10.38::You need to ensure that virtual machines on VNET1 and VNET2 are included automatically in a DNS zone named contosoazure. The solution must ensure that the virtual machines on VNET1 and VNET2 can resolve the names of the virtual machines on either virtual network.


# 3nd.4from10.39::You need to ensure that you can deploy Azure virtual machines to the France Central Azure region. The solution must ensure that virtual machines in the France Central region are in a network segment that has an IP address range of 10.5.1.0/24.


# 3nd.5from10.40::You need to ensure that hosts on VNET1 and VNET2 can communicate. The solution must minimize latency between the virtual networks.

# 3nd.6from10.41::You need to ensure that the owner of VNET3 receives an alert if an administrative operation is performed in the virtual network.


# 3nd.7from10.42::You need to archive all the metrics of VNET1 to an existing storage account.



# 3nd.8from10.43::You plan to deploy 100 virtual machines to subnet-1. The virtual machines will NOT be assigned a public IP address. The virtual machines will call the same API which is hosted by a third party. The virtual machines will make more than 10,000 calls per minute to the API.

You need to minimize the risk of SNAT port exhaustion. The solution must minimize administrative effort.

# 3nd.9from10.44::You plan to deploy an appliance to subnet3-2. The appliance will perform packet inspection and will have an IP address of 10.3.2.100.

You need to ensure that all traffic to the internet from subnet3-1 is forwarded to the appliance for inspection.



# 3nd.10from10.45::You plan to use VNET4 for an Azure API Management implementation.

You need to configure a policy that can be used by an Azure application gateway to protect against known web attack vectors. The policy must only allow requests that originate from IP addresses in Canada. You do NOT need to create the application gateway to complete this task.


# 4th.1from4.46::You plan to deploy several virtual machines to subnet1-2.

You need to prevent all Azure hosts outside of subnet1-2 from connecting to TCP port 5585 on hosts on subnet1-2. The solution must minimize administrative effort.


# 4th.2from4.47::You need to ensure that only hosts on VNET1 can access the storage123456789 storage account. The solution must ensure that access occurs over the Azure backbone network.


# 4th.3from4.71::You plan to deploy a VPN gateway and an ExpressRoute gateway to VNET2.

You need to prepare VNET2 to ensure that you can deploy the gateways.

# 4th.4from4.72::You plan to manage the public DNS records for a domain named fabrikam.com by using an Azure solution.

You need to ensure that wvw.fabrikam.com resolves to 131.107.2.50.



# 5th.1from2.73::You plan to configure a VPN tunnel for VNET2.

You need to ensure that all internet traffic from subnet2-1 is routed through an on-premises firewall before reaching the destination. The solution must be achieved without using dynamic routing protocols.

# 5th.2from2.74::You plan to deploy two DNS servers to subnet2-1. Each server will host a DNS zone for fabrikam,com. The DNS zones will contain records from the on-premises network only. The IP address of the DNS servers will be 10.2.1.4 and 10.2.1.5.

You need to ensure that virtual machines on VNET2 can resolve the names of the on-premises servers in fabrikam.com.



# 6th.1from1.39::You plan to deploy a firewall to subnet1-2. The firewall will have an IP address of 10.1.2.4.

You need to ensure that traffic from subnet1-1 to the IP address range of 192.168.10.0/24 is
routed through the firewall that will be deployed to subnet 1-2. The solution must be achieved
without using dynamic routing protocol.



# 7th.1from1.58::You need to ensure that traffic to host.fabrikam.com is directed to the Traffic Manager profile.
