. To implement an Azure Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) solution, you must sync on-premises identities to the cloud
=>NO
It is not true that you must deploy a federation solution or sync on-premises identities to the cloud. You can have a cloud-only environment and use MFA.

. You need to ensure that when Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) users connect to Azure AD from the Internet by using an anonymous IP address, the users are prompted automatically to change their password. Which Azure service should you use?
=> 
Azure AD Identity Protection 👈

User accounts in Azure Active Directory can be assigned multiple licenses for different Azure or Microsoft 365 services.

Resource groups provide organizations with the ability to manage the compliance of Azure resources across multiple subscriptions.
=> management group 


 Each Azure subscription can be managed by using a Microsoft account only 
=> no 
You need an Azure Active Directory account to manage a subscription, not a Microsoft account.

 When you need to delegate permissions to several Azure virtual machines simultaneously, you must deploy the Azure virtual machine
=> to the same resource group 👈
 The permissions you apply to the resource group apply to all resources contained in the resource group.

 An Azure subscription can be associated to multiple Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants 
=> no
An Azure AD tenant can have multiple subscriptions but an Azure subscription can only be associated with one Azure AD tenant.


a virtual network gateway ☑ connecting your workloads in Azure Virtual Network to your on premises sites.
a gateway subnet 👈 you specify when configuring your virtual network.
no 
an application gateway - enables you to manage traffic to your web applications.
a virtual network - enables communication between multiple computers, virtual machines (VMs), virtual servers, or other devices across different office and data center locations.

Local network gateways - The local network gateway (LNG) typically refers to your on-premises location. It is not the same as a virtual network gateway. You give the site a name by which Azure can refer to it, then specify the IP address of the on-premises VPN device to which you will create a connection


 A single Microsoft account can be used to manage multiple Azure subscription
=> YES 
You can use the same account to manage multiple subscriptions. You can create an additional subscription for your account in the Azure portal.

. Your company plans to purchase an Azure subscription. The companyג€™s support policy states that the Azure environment must provide an option to access support engineers by phone or email. You need to recommend which support plan meets the support policy requirement. Solution: Recommend a Professional Direct support plan. => Yes
The Basic support plan does not have any technical support for engineers.
The Developer support plan has only technical support for engineers via email.
The Standard, Professional Direct, and Premier support plans have technical support for engineers via email and phone.

. An Azure service in private preview is released to all Azure customers => no
 The private preview is only available to certain Azure customers for evaluation purposes.

. An Azure free account can contain an unlimited number of web apps	=> No
Azure free account has a limit of 10 web, mobile or API apps


. The Service Level Agreement (SLA) guaranteed uptime for paid Azure is at least 99,9 percent => Yes 
SLAג€™s vary based on the resource type and the location distribution of the resource. However, the minimum uptime for all Azure services is 99.9 percent.


. You can stop an Azure SQL Database instance to decrease costs. => No
There is no way to stop SQL Azure Database to avoid billing charges when not in use. The azure virtual machine can be suspended and by doing that you can avoid hourly charges, but you cannot do the same with a SQL Azure Database which is charged hourly per database
..................

. With a consumtion-based plan, you pay a fixed rate for all data sent to or from virtual machines hosted in the cloud 
=> Consumption-based price - You are charged for only what you use. This model is also known as the Pay-As-You-Go rate.



Company can extend an internal network by adding its own physical servers to the public cloud
=> No => 
You cannot add physical servers to the public cloud. You can only deploy virtual servers in the public cloud. You can extend a private cloud by deploying virtual servers in a public cloud. This would create a hybrid cloud.



. An Azure administrator plans to run a PowerShell script that creates Azure resources. You need to recommend which computer configuration to use to run the script. Which three computers can run the script? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.














You are planning to migrate a company to Azure. Each of the companyג€™s numerous divisions will have an administrator in place to manage the Azure resources used by their respective division. You want to make sure that the Azure deployment you employ allows for Azure to be segmented for the divisions, while keeping administrative effort to a minimum. Solution: You plan to make use of several Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directories. Does the solution meet the goal?

I think the key word is SEVERAL. Why in the world a company will create SEVERAL AADs when it can create a single AAD and organize its divisions right there?








reread eventually:

azure synapse analytics = Warehouse
Azure HDInsight = HaDoop

Box 2: Yes -
Usage scenarios for the hot access tier include:
✑ Data that is in active use or is expected to be read from and written to frequently
✑ Data that is staged for processing and eventual migration to the cool access tier

Box 3: No -
Usage scenarios for the cool access tier include:
Short-term backup and disaster recovery

✑ Older data not used frequently but expected to be available immediately when accessed
✑ Large data sets that need to be stored cost effectively, while more data is being gathered for future processing
. Azure PowerShell modules can be installed on macOS.

. You have an Azure environment. You need to create a new Azure virtual machine from a tablet that runs the Android operating system. Solution: You use PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell.

 . If you have Azure resource deployed to every region, you can implement availability zones in all the regions =>
Not all Azure regions support availability zones.

Windows Virtual Desktop supports desktop and app virtualization. - Via RemoteApps 

Azure storage offers different access tiers: hot, cool and archive.
The archive access tier has the lowest storage cost. But it has higher data retrieval costs compared to the hot and cool tiers. Data in the archive tier can take several hours to retrieve.
While a blob is in archive storage, the blob data is offline and can't be read, overwritten, or modified. To read or download a blob in archive, you must first rehydrate it to an online tier.
Example usage scenarios for the archive access tier include:
✑ Long-term backup, secondary backup, and archival datasets
✑ Original (raw) data that must be preserved, even after it has been processed into final usable form.
✑ Compliance and archival data that needs to be stored for a long time and is hardly ever accessed.
Reference:


Box 1: Yes -
There are different replication options available with a storage account. The ג€˜minimumג€™ replication option is Locally Redundant Storage (LRS). With LRS, data is replicated synchronously three times within the primary region.

Box 2: No -
Data is not backed up automatically to another Azure Data Center although it can be depending on the replication option configured for the account. Locally
Redundant Storage (LRS) is the default which maintains three copies of the data in the data center.
Geo-redundant storage (GRS) has cross-regional replication to protect against regional outages. Data is replicated synchronously three times in the primary region, then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region.

Box 3: No -
The limits are much higher than that. The current storage limit is 2 PB for US and Europe, and 500 TB for all other regions (including the UK) with no limit on the number of files.



. To use Azure Active Direcotry (Azure AD) credentials to sign in to a computer that runs Windows 10, the computer must be joined to Azure AD
