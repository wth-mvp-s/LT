A single dental X-ray typically delivers an effective dose of about 0.005 mSv.(millisieverts )
The average background radiation exposure from natural sources is about 3 mSv per year in the United States.

    Cosmic Radiation, 
    Terrestrial Radiation:  elements like uranium, thorium, and potassium-40. 
    Radon: Radon gas is a significant source of natural radiation. It’s a radioactive gas that results from the decay of uranium in the Earth's crust and can accumulate in buildings, particularly basements and other low-lying areas.
    Internal Radiation: This comes from radioactive substances within the body. For example, potassium-40 is a naturally occurring isotope present in many foods and in the human body.

Rolf Maximilian Sievert, a Swedish medical physicist
    According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), one sievert results in a 5.5% probability of eventually developing fatal cancer based on the disputed linear no-threshold model of ionizing radiation exposure.[1][2]
