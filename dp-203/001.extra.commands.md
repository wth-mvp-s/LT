#### 0024::
`You have an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool named Pool1 and a database named DB1. DB1 contains a fact table named Table1.
`You need to identify the extent of the data skew in Table1.
`What should you do in Synapse Studio?
`::
`This dynamic management view (DMV) can be used to show statistics for partitions of tables and indexes in a SQL pool. By querying this view, you can check the skew of data distributed across the distribution database. Other options do not provide the necessary data about data skew.

- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and run sys.dm_pdw_nodes_db_partition_stats. ? 
- [ ] Connect to Pool1 and run DBCC CHECKALLOC.
- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and run DBCC CHECKALLOC.
- [x] Connect to Pool1 and query sys.dm_pdw_nodes_db_partition_stats.

#### 0028::
`You have an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool named SA1 that contains a table named Table1.
`You need to identify tables that have a high percentage of deleted rows.
`What should you run?
`::
`This DMV provides information about the row groups within the columnstore tables on each node of the SQL pool. The deleted_rows column indicates the number of rows that have been logically deleted from the rowgroup. This can help in identifying tables with a high percentage of deleted rows. Other options are not directly associated with deleted row data.

- [ ] sys.pdw_nodes_column_store_segments
- [ ] sys.dm_db_column_store_row_group_operational_stats
- [x] sys.pdw_nodes_column_store_row_groups
- [ ] sys.dm_db_column_store_row_group_physical_stats


#### 0035::
`You have an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool named Pool1 and a database named DB1. DB1 contains a fact table named Table1.
`You need to identify the extent of the data skew in Table1.
`What should you do in Synapse Studio?
`::
`Similar to 0024, this DMV provides information about the data skew across the different partitions of the tables and indexes in your SQL pool. Other options either don't provide relevant information or they involve connecting to the wrong resource (the built-in pool instead of Pool1).

- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and query sys.dm_pdw_nodes_db_partition_stats.
- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and run DBCC CHECKALLOC.
- [ ] Connect to Pool1 and query sys.dm_pdw_node_status.
- [x] Connect to Pool1 and query sys.dm_pdw_nodes_db_partition_stats.


#### 0036::
`You have an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool named Pool1. Pool1 contains a fact table named Table1.
`You need to identify the extent of the data skew in Table1.
`What should you do in Synapse Studio?
`::
`DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED is a command specific to Azure Synapse Analytics. It returns size information for the current database in a SQL Data Warehouse. This can be used to identify the extent of data skew in a table by examining the space used by the table's data. Other options do not provide this specific information.

- [x] Connect to Pool1 and DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED.
- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and run DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED.
- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and run DBCC CHECKALLOC.
- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and query sys.dm_pdw_sys_info.

#### 0038::
`You have an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool named Pool1. Pool1 contains a fact table named Table1.
`
`You need to identify the extent of the data skew in Table1.
`
`What should you do in Synapse Studio?
`::
`The command DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED can be used to identify the extent of data skew in a table.

- [x] Connect to Pool1 and run DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED.
- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and run DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED.
- [ ] Connect to Pool1 and run DBCC CHECKALLOC.
- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and query sys.dm_pdw_sys_info.


#### 008::
`You have an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool named Pool1 and a database named DB1. DB1 contains a fact table named Table1.
`You need to identify the extent of the data skew in Table1.
`What should you do in Synapse Studio?
`::
`This DMV provides information about data skew across the different partitions of the tables and indexes in your SQL pool.

- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and run DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED.
- [ ] Connect to the built-in pool and run DBCC CHECKALLOC.
- [ ] Connect to Pool1 and query sys.dm_pdw_node_status.
- [x] Connect to Pool1 and query sys.dm_pdw_nodes_db_partition_stats.


#### 0010::
`You have a SQL pool in Azure Synapse.
`You discover that some queries fail or take a long time to complete.
`You need to monitor for transactions that have rolled back.
`Which dynamic management view should you query?
`::
`This DMV can be used to monitor transactions that have rolled back. It provides information about all transactions in the system, both active and inactive. In particular, the 'status' column gives the status of the transaction and can be used to identify transactions that have rolled back. Other options don't provide direct information about transaction statuses.

- [ ] sys.dm_pdw_request_steps
- [x] sys.dm_pdw_nodes_tran_database_transactions
- [ ] sys.dm_pdw_waits
- [ ] sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions
