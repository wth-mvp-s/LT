`You have an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool that contains a table named Table1.
`You have files that are ingested and loaded into an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 container named container1.
`You plan to insert data from the files in container1 into Table1 and transform the data. Each row of data in the files will produce one row in the serving layer of Table1.
`You need to ensure that when the source data files are loaded to container1, the DateTime is stored as an additional column in Table1.
`Solution: In an Azure Synapse Analytics pipeline, you use a data flow that contains a Derived Column transformation.
