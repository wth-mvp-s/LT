`You plan to create an Azure Databricks workspace that has a tiered structure. The workspace will contain the following three workloads:
`✑ A workload for data engineers who will use Python and SQL.
`✑ A workload for jobs that will run notebooks that use Python, Scala, and SQL.
`✑ A workload that data scientists will use to perform ad hoc analysis in Scala and R.
`The enterprise architecture team at your company identifies the following standards for Databricks environments:
`✑ The data engineers must share a cluster.
`✑ The job cluster will be managed by using a request process whereby data scientists and data engineers provide packaged notebooks for deployment to the cluster.
`✑ All the data scientists must be assigned their own cluster that terminates automatically after 120 minutes of inactivity. Currently, there are three data scientists.
`You need to create the Databricks clusters for the workloads.
`Solution: You create a Standard cluster for each data scientist, a Standard cluster for the data engineers, and a High Concurrency cluster for the jobs.
`Does this meet the goal?
- [ ] Yes
