`You are designing an enterprise data warehouse in Azure Synapse Analytics that will contain a table named Customers. Customers will contain credit card information.
`You need to recommend a solution to provide salespeople with the ability to view all the entries in Customers. The solution must prevent all the salespeople from viewing or inferring the credit card information.
`What should you include in the recommendation?
- [ ] data masking
- [ ] Always Encrypted
- [x] column-level security
- [ ] row-level security

#### 007::
`You are designing an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool.
`You need to ensure that you can audit access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
`What should you include in the solution?
- [ ] column-level security
- [ ] dynamic data masking
- [ ] row-level security (RLS)
- [x] sensitivity classifications


#### 0037::
`You have an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool that contains a table named dbo.Users.
`
`You need to prevent a group of users from reading user email addresses from dbo.Users.
`
`What should you use?

- [x] column-level security
- [ ] row-level security (RLS)
- [ ] Transparent Data Encryption (TOE)
- [ ] dynamic data masking

#### 0038::
`You have an Azure Synapse Analytics dedicated SQL pool that hosts a database named DB1.
`
`You need to ensure that DB1 meets the following security requirements:
`
`• When credit card numbers show in applications, only the last four digits must be visible.
`• Tax numbers must be visible only to specific users.
`
`What should you use for each requirement?
- [ ] Credit card numers: Column-level security
- [x] Credit card numers: Dynamic Data Masking
- [ ] Credit card numers: Row-level security (RLS)
- [x] Tax numbers: Column-level security
- [ ] Tax numbers: Row-level security (RLS)
- [ ] Tax numbers: Transparent Database Encryption (TDE)
