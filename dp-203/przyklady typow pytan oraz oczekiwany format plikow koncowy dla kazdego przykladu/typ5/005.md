#### 00374::You have a GitHub repository.
`You have an app named App1. You have a Log Analytics workspace named Workspace1 that contains a table named AppEvents. App1 writes logs to
Workspace1.
`You need to query the AppEvents table. The solution must meet the following requirements:
`✑ Only query rows for a column named Name that starts with the following text: "Clicked Create New Ticket."
`✑ Calculate the number of daily clicks per user.
`✑ Return the top 10 users based on their number of clicks for any day.
`✑ Sort the results based on the highest number of clicks.
`✑ Ignore any users who have less than three daily clicks.
`In which order should you arrange the query statements? To answer, move all statements from the list of statements to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

- [0] AppEvents
- [1] | where Name startswith "Clicked Create New Ticket"
- [2] | summarize NumberOfClicks = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, Id),
- [3] | where NumberOfClicks >= 3
- [4] | top 10 by NumberOfClicks desc
