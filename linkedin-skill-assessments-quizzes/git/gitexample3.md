#### Q18. After checking your git status you get the following output, which shows the file beta-notes.js in the commit but also unstaged. How can this situation occur?
```shell
`Change to be committed:
`(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
`modified: beta-notes.js
`Changes not staged for commit:
`(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
`(use "git checkout --<file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
`modified: beta-notes.js
```

- [ ] There were two copies of beta-notes.js but one was deleted
- [x] beta-notes.js was staged, then modified afterwards, creating two different versions of the file
- [ ] Two copies of beta-notes.js were created, but only one is being tracked
- [ ] There are two tracked copies of beta-notes.js, but one was removed from the commit
